            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may ſerue greatly to thy edification (gentle Reader) as it alſo perteineth much to my purpoſe in this booke, to let thée vnderſtande, that where as there are two wayes of finding out Chriſtian truth when it is in controuerſie, the one by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of euery matter in particuler, the other by giuing certayne generall rules that are infallible: Twelue or thirtéene yeres agoe M.D. Allen, hauing amongſt other learned Catholikes of our time and countrey on this ſide the ſea, opened and defended in print moſt perſpicuouſly and ſubſtantially, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ſpeciall articles of the Catholike ſaith: and béeing driuen not long after by ſicknes to ſéeke to the ayre of his natiue ſoyle, did in the ſhort ſpace of his abode there, deale alſo the other waye with many Gentlemen, confirming ſome, and ſetting vp agayne others, by moſt euident and vndouted rules of truth, which were alwayes common for the moſt part among Catholikes, but the weight of them déepely conſidered of very few, and the number of them as yet neither by him nor by any other bound vp together. Onely to one gentleman requeſting ſo much, he gaue a copie of them, ſuche a one as of extemporall and priuate writing might be looked for.</p>
            <p>It is now nine yeres ſince I heard the ſame of his own mouth, what time I came firſt into his bleſſed familie, and was preſent very often when amongſt vs he diſcourſed familiarly vpon the ſaid rules, to ſuch liking of my part, that I left him not vntill I had intreated him to take his penne one morning, and out of his memorie to frame me alſo a copie. Which copie a friende hauing ſéene here with me, who afterward was ſent home into our lords harueſt, in a letter from thence deſired inſtantly to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker therof, affirming that he ſaw how medicinable it would be to many ſoules, I communicated the matter to the Author of it. He béeing wholly occupied him ſelfe in publike teaching of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, would haue me who then had more leaſure, though for
<pb facs="tcp:11533:3"/>
ſkill not worthy to beare his booke, to deuiſe ſomewhat vpon thoſe and the like rules, which might in print be publiſhed to the world: not as though the very bare rules, as in the foreſaid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, were not conuenient and ſufficient, ſpecially for men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence and that willingly would be informed, but that by the declaration and confirmation of them the rude alſo and obſtinate might be induced. And this was the occaſion of my <hi>Motiues</hi> in the ende of the yeare 1574. and alſo of my <hi>Demaundes</hi> in the beginning of the yeare 1576, which I made vpon the motion of certayne, who deſired to haue the Motiues printed agayne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt impreſſion was for the greater part taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the aduerſaries.</p>
            <p>And now after all this, the laſt yeare 1577. commeth foorth from one <hi>W. Fulke</hi> an heretike, a pretended anſwere to the firſt copie aboue mentioned, or to ſome extract thereof, ioyned with another like anſwere of the ſame Authors to D. Allens <hi>booke of Purgatorie,</hi> and to my handes it came a fewe wéekes agoe, euen <note place="margin">an. 1578 ſtylo R.</note>this late Chriſtmas. Sith which time reading it twiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I finde, that he neuer ſo much as once mentioneth either my Motiues, or my Demaundes, and much leſſe doth he euer goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to infringe any of my probations therein conteined. And yet notwithſtanding this depe ſilence,<note place="margin">Fulke li. 2. p. 107.</note> in one place he bewrayeth him ſelfe to haue knowen of them, where he glaunceth at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worke of a certayne healing which I reported in my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,<note place="margin">Moti. 5. fol. 19.</note> and ſayth, <hi>As you haue myracles now in Flaunders of the honeſt woman of the olde Baily in London.</hi> Although other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo who can thinke it poſſible for him to haue heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (at leaſt when he ſought to print his) of bookes written ſo late of the ſame matter, and ſo well knowen to the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of London and innumerable others of that ſide, whiche alſo any man that had ſéene the copie that Fulke anſwereth, might eaſily conceiue to procéede from the ſame Author, and me onely to be his ſcholar, howbeit I alſo not obſcurely profeſſed as much, where I ſaid:<note place="margin">Mot. f. 2·</note>
               <q>[The preiudices and euidences for the Catholike faith againſt all hereſies, are innumerable and ſuperable: and my chaunce it hath bene, through the mercifull prouidence and goodnes of God, to liue certayne yeres in companie with Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like men of great vertue, wiſdome, and knowlege, bleſſed of God

            </p>
            <p>If I may ſay what I do gheſſe hereat, I ſuppoſe that it ſhould ſtill haue lyen by him,<note place="margin">Fulk to the Reader.</note> as it hath done (he ſaith) <hi>theſe eyght or nyne yeares,</hi> and neuer haue bene put in print, but only for ſhew of an anſwere to my Motiues and Demaundes, ſpecially ſéeing that, where as D. Allens writing was called onely by the name of <hi>Articles,</hi> this man at euery Article hath alſo printed the worde <hi>Demaundes,</hi> becauſe euery Article conſiſteth of certayne Demaundes: by meane whereof I knowe already my ſelfe, ſome that are deceyued, and thinke it to be an anſwere vnto me, yet in trueth it toucheth not me at all, neither maketh any iuſte anſwere to D.

            <p>All which conſidered, I doubted a while, whether it were good to returne him an anſwer, or no, leaſt peraduenture I ſhould but leaſe my labour, &amp; rather to expect yet ſomewhat longer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any do anſwer my Motiues or Demaunds, as by aduiſe out

Yet my reſolution hath bene, ſéeing that <hi>abundans cautio non nocet,</hi> to put out my hande a litle, and take of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, that being playnly diſcouered, euery man may beholde and abhorre his foule fauour, and beare me witneſſe that he had bene better to kéepe in, not onely thoſe nine yeres and two yeres, but alſo for euer, following rather the enſamples of thoſe other two brethren mentioned in his preface to the Reader, of whom <hi>the one purpoſed to haue anſwered the booke of Purgatory himſelf, but afterward vndertooke rather the printing of Fulkes anſwere: the other learnedly began the anſwering of it, but was, he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not how, letted from the accompliſhing of the ſame. So hath Satan hitherto hindred the ſetting abrode of this anſwere</hi> (ſayth he of his owne) <hi>but God hath now at length brought it forth: I doubt not</hi> (he addeth) <hi>but to his glory, and the confuſion of ſatan in his members the Papiſtes.</hi> As I alſo doubt not, but God in déede hath brought it forth, to his glory, and to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of hereſie, ſo, that ſatan had done more politikely, to haue hindred ſtill, if he could, the ſetting abrode of it, ſuch ſtuffe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth. Better ſtuffe we ſhould haue had, if better had they had.</p>
            <p>Well, ſéeing that M.D. Allen is otherwiſe and better occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, I, who haue already ſuccéeded him in his Articles, and do owe vnto him (at one worde) all duetie, both for the publike, and namely for my priuate, will here with the helpe of God, laye ſo much of Fulks wares open, out of both his bookes, that although my meaning is directly againſt his firſt booke, yet my treatiſe ſhall appeare to be a iuſt reply to both his bookes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt therefore I will ſhew briefly, how he confeſſeth, <hi>that out of the true Church is no ſaluation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentes more at large in the ende of this booke.</note> to this ende, that when as in my proceſſe it ſhall be manifeſt, that he and his felowes are out of the true Church, and that we haue the true Church, both they may clearely ſée in what caſe they ſtand, and their felowes may looke in time vnto their reconciliation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, I will ſhewe ſomewhat more at large, for what ſpace he graunteth the true Church to haue continued in ſight and knowledge of the world, and what perſons and companies to haue bene of it: to the ende, that neither he nor no man elſe being able to proue that we agrée not with thoſe times and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb facs="tcp:11533:4"/>
in ſubſtance of religion, or haue gone out of the vnitie of their communion, it may euidently be ſéene, that we likewiſe at this time be of the ſame true Church, and he with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to be without the true Church, becauſe they be out of our Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for as much as on the other ſide he could not denie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but that he and his agrée not with the ſaide true Church, I will ſhew, how he is fayne to holde that the true Church may erre, and that he chargeth it then with the ſame errours, with the which he chargeth vs now: to the end that thou mayſt ſée, that for all thoſe ſurmiſed errours, he hath not any iuſt cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vs the true Church, which he giueth to them that with vs were in the ſame errours.</p>
            <p>Nay, I will further declare in the fourth place, that he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> them with diuers errors, wherewith he neither can nor doth charge vs: that it may much more appeare, that we haue the true Church nowe, if they ſo much worſe then we, had the true Church then.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, I wil report the reaſon for which (by his ſaying) they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> had the true Church then, notwithſtanding their errors: to the end, that where thou ſhalt ſée it to be ſuch a reaſon as agréeth to vs nowe as well, thou mayſt perceyue, that he muſt no leſſe graunt vs the true Church now.</p>
            <p>After this I will note briefly his zeal towards Caluin and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> others that in déede are, or at leaſt be vnfaignedly thought of him to be of his Church at this time, how that he can not in any wiſe beare any thing to be ſpoken agaynſt them, whereas yet he not onely can beare, but alſo him ſelfe ſpeaketh ſo much agaynſt the olde auncient Church, and the members thereof. And in conſideration hereof my Catholike zeale muſt do no leſſe (as béeing in déede with all other Catholikes of this time, a member of the very ſame auncient Church in olde time) but anſwere for the ſaid Church, ſhewing in euery particuler, how vnworthily and vniuſtly he chargeth it with erring. Which I will in like maner do for the Church alſo of later times, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it likewiſe againſt all his like accuſations of it.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, I will declare, howe that, ſéeing manifeſtly the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> true Church, Councels, Fathers, and all other euidences of
<pb facs="tcp:11533:5"/>
Chriſtian Religion, to make cléerely againſt him and his, he is faine, and nothing abaſht at the matter, to take exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all, by the bare name and colour of Onely Scripture: and therein behaueth him ſelfe ſo boldly, as if the holy Scripture were as manifeſtly with him, as all the other are manifeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Where alſo becauſe, like an other Phormio <hi>homo confidens,</hi> he prouoketh vs to a diſputation of Scripture, I will make him a reaſonable offer.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, I will moſt cléerely ſhew, how that, not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all theſe great crakes and bolde facinges of his, he hath not for all that in theſe two bookes alleaged ſo much as one text of Scripture that maketh any whit againſt vs. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I will aunſwer all his allegations: firſt, concerning One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture to be credited: next, concerning the Church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can erre, and whether we haue it or they: then, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Purgatory: and laſt of all, concerning all other matters that any where he mentioneth by the way.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, I will likewiſe ſhew, whereas he maketh himſelfe ſo ſure of Scripture, that he holdeth the teſtimonies of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Fathers to be no confirmation of trueth, and allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them ſometimes notwithſtanding: although becauſe of his ſo holding, I might neglect thoſe allegations, yet I will ſhewe (I ſay) that of all which he alleageth, no one, neither expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth any Scripture, nor beareth any other teſtimonie with him againſt vs. Which wil be a plaine demonſtration of that which I propoſed here aboue in the ſecond Chapter, to wit, that wée haue ſtill the true Church, becauſe we ſtill ſo throughly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely agrée with them, who by his owne confeſſion had in their time the true Church.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Tenthly, becauſe all D. Allens Articles are in effect contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in my Motiues and Demaundes, I will examine what he anſwereth, not to my probations (for to them, or any one of them, he lightly anſwereth not, as I ſay afore) but euen to the bare titles of them. And for as much as his anſweres will ſoone appeare to be no anſwers, I will examine, whether at the leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he obiecteth any thing to the purpoſe: to the end, that when thou ſhalt ſée that all is ſo litle or rather nothing at all, thou maiſt perceaue, that God for his Churches glory blinded them,
<pb facs="tcp:11533:5"/>
to ſend ſuch a booke abroade.</p>
            <p>Which thou ſhalt againe more plainely perceaue in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Chapter, where I will lay forth his marueilous groſſe and palpable contradictions, yea and in great numbers alſo.</p>
            <p>And againe, as plainely in the twelft Chapter, where I will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> diſplay certaine ſtraunge and deteſtable poſitions of his, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his ignoraunce in the Scriptures and other learning Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall. To the which I might but for prolixitie ioyne many enſamples perteining to a falſarie, putting him in minde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, of his horrible blaſphemies, as him ſelfe alſo muſt confeſſe them to be, becauſe he can not auoide it but that the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he hath poured them, is the true Church.</p>
            <p>In the concluſion, I will amongſt ſome other things aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> the Reader, what more may be deſired for the full iuſtifying of the booke of Purgatorie, though this much be ynough and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundaunt. but, for iuſtification of the Articles, that no more can be deſired.</p>

And this I thinke (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) is the righte pedigree of prayers for the dead and Purgatorie. <hi>And in an other place yet more particularly:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Pur. 416.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11533:17"/>
aſsigned three places for the ſoules departed. <hi>And who elſe?</hi> Carpocrates was a great admirer of Philoſophie. This Heretike learning out of Plato his Philoſophie, that mens ſoules muſt be purified after their death, inuented a kinde of Purgatorie out of the opinion of Pythagoras. <hi>Yet forwarde:</hi> Origen to muche a Philoſopher, was not content with Plato his purification, but he muſt bring in Platoes fire alſo. <hi>Is this all?</hi> Afterwarde about S. Auguſtines time, the name of Purgatorie was firſt inuented, by ſome mediators and conciliators of Origens error with the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous practiſe of the Churche. <hi>Here loe we haue the thirde place, the purification, the fire, and the name: We lacke nowe but the relieuing of the Soules there. For that he ſaith:</hi> The Heracleonites would redeme their dead after a new maner, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by oyle, balme, water, and Inuocation ſaid ouer their heades in the Hebrew tongue. But (<hi>at one ſtroke to ſtrike vs ſtarke dead</hi>) Montanus had in all poyntes the opinion of the Papiſtes. Firſt that the Patriarkes before Chriſtes comming were in hell: That Abrahams boſome was in hell, or in the lower partes: That on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs and perfect men are priuileged of God to goe to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe: That all ſmall offences muſt be puniſhed after this life, where the priſon is, and the vttermoſt farthing to be payed. <hi>Then for prayers a litle after:</hi> And therefore (<hi>ſayth he</hi>) it is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be thought, but that the Montaniſtes vpon the grounde of this opinion, not content with the oblations for the dead (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the Church then had by peruerſe emulation of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Oblations of thanks giuing alſo, are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish.</note> and yet were but oblations of thankes giuing) they added alſo prayers for the ſpirites of them that were dead, whereof Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian maketh mention. <hi>And that you may not doubt whether he charge vs alone, or alſo the auncient Fathers, with all this, goe to his wordes alleaged out of the ſame place in this Chapter by me afore, beginning thus:</hi> And this was a great corruption of thoſe auncient times, that if the Gentils or Heretiks had any thing that ſeemed to haue a ſhew of pietie, or charitie, they would draw it into vſe, &amp;c. <hi>After all this he concludeth in the ende, ſaying:</hi> Wherfore it is left that Montanus and his felowes were the firſt that taught prayers for the dead to be profitable. <hi>And agayne:</hi> Therfore Aërius was not the firſt that held our opinion: but Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>D.

As for that which he ſayeth there,</hi> of abuſes and corruptions entered into the Church of Chriſt as a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the Religion of the Papiſtes, <hi>it belonged to the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

                  <note place="margin">Supra pag.</note> 
                  <hi>And ſo much of the Apoſtles time, and alſo of the time immediatly after the Apoſtles.

And therefore it was no ſuch time, but that he and all his fellowes might and did erre, in ſome opinions, contrarie to the trueth of Gods worde. <hi>And lower agayne,</hi> Vnder the Emperours,<note place="margin">Ar. 15.</note> Conſtantius, Conſtans, and Valence, the true Churche was greatly infected with the hereſie of Arius: what time alſo Liberius Byſhop of Rome was infected with the ſame hereſie. <hi>Straight after that time did Sainct Hierome floriſhe, whom amongeſt others in the ſeconde Chapter he confeſſed to bée a member of the true Churche: And him he chargeth not onely,</hi>

                  <hi>But alſo thus in an other place:</hi> Conſider what perilous aſſertions theſe be: that the Lambe is euery where: and that the Martyrs are euerye where: this is to deſtroye the humanitie of Chriſt, and to geue diuinitie vnto the Martyrs. I doubte not but Sainct Ieronym, if he had quietly conſidered theſe abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,<note place="margin">He lacked but ſuch a monitor.</note> woulde haue reuoked them as erroneous and hereticall: but whyle he rather followed affection then iudgement, you may ſee howe he was deceaued. <hi>At the ſame time was the thirde Councell of Carthage, and Sainct Auguſtine one of the Byſhops thereof.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ar. 89.</note> 
                  <hi>It he chargeth thus:</hi> The Councell of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage the third, Cap. 23. determined, that all prayers at the Altar ſhould be directed onely to the Father, and not to the Sonne, or the holy Ghoſt. Whether this be an error, to define, That it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to pray to God the Sonne, and God the holy Ghoſt, let euery man iudge. <hi>And to put more weight to this his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, he addeth:</hi> But you will except that this was a prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Synode, and not a Generall Councell.

               <p>Howe much more warely dealt your maiſter Peter Martyr vpon this place to the Corinthians, who ſéeing the abſurdities hereof,<note place="margin">Pet. Mar in. 1.

                  <q>It happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth often (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) that ſuch as in their whole life time had not the gift to thinke a right of Religion, haue it often geuen them at the laſt houre: to vnderſtand in the agonie of death, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions and abuſes to which afore they had yealded them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, were both vaine and alſo hurtfull. Which thing I would not doubt to haue happened to Bernard, Fraunciſe, Dominike, and many of the auncient Fathers: becauſe liuing in the foundation, that is, in Chriſt, although they builded many abuſes and very many ſuperſtitions, yet they might be ſaued: howbeit through fire, what time at the laſt houre they wreſtled againſt death and the terrors of their ſinnes, and in that wraſtling acknowledged the vanitie of their fanſies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſée how they are troubled to ſaue them whom (no leſſe then vs) they ſhould, but dare not to condemne: and while they labour ſo to do, they do it (ſpecially Fulke) by ſuch meanes, as no leſſe ſerueth to ſaue vs. For who knoweth not, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue in the onely Sonne of God, and in the onely mercy of God? and that therefore we looke not to be ſaued by our owne works, that is to ſay, which we did without him, as when we were in Paganiſme, or in Iudaiſme, or in Caluiniſme, and any other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, or finally in any mortall ſinne, but onely by his workes, that is, by his Sacraments that of his great mercy he hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for vs, &amp; the good déeds that of his great mercy he hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vs, in Chriſt Ieſus? euen as S.

                     <hi>but for his mercy he hath ſaued vs, by Baptiſme</hi> per lanacrum generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis:</hi> that thou maiſt ſée his mercy and his ſacrament ſtande well together.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note> And againe: <hi>for wee be his</hi> (new) <hi>creature, created in Chriſt Ieſus, in good workes.</hi> And therefore afore we were in Chriſt Ieſus, we had no works to ſaue vs: but they are our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes only in Chriſt Ieſus, that ſaue vs. For ſo the ſame S.

But how appeareth it that they defined ſo? becauſe they <hi>determined, that al prayers at the Altar ſhould be directed only to the Father, and not to the Sonne,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Con. Car. 3. ca. 23.</note> 
                           <hi>or the holy Ghoſt.</hi> The wordes of the Councell truely reported, are theſe:
<q>Vt nemo in precibus, &amp;c. That no man in prayers name eyther the Father for the Sonne, or the Sonne for the Father. <hi>For that were to confound the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, after the hereſie of Sabellius.

Now doth it folow of this, that no prayers may be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Sonne and holy Ghoſt?<note place="margin">Such are his neceſſarie col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections.</note> or alſo, that the very prayers at the Altar, may not be directed to them, that they may not (I ſay) becauſe for order ſake they are appoynted to be directed to the Father?</p>

<q>Thou ſayeſt that many haue asked thee of the ſacrifice of the body and bloud of Chriſt, which many thinke to be offered to the Father onely.

For though he that offereth, directeth the prayer to the perſon of the Father, this is not any preiudice to the Sonne, or to the holy Ghoſt. <hi>He declareth it thus, becauſe</hi> The concluſion of the ſame prayer, for ſo muche as it hath the name of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt, ſheweth that there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Trinitie. <hi>Looke in the Canon of the Maſſe, and you ſhall more eaſily perceiue his meaning.</hi>

                        <p>But the next error of our Church, is (I trow) vnanſwerable, being ſuch a one alſo, as not only ſheweth vs to erre, but moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer depriueth vs of al certentie of truth.

                           <q>Vpon this occaſion <hi>this Councell</hi> doth declare, determine, and define, that although Chriſt did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute after ſupper this venerable ſacrament (<hi>there is one piece:</hi>) And did miniſter it to his diſciples vnder both formes of bread and wine, (<hi>there is the other piece:</hi>) yet this notwithſtanding, the authoritie of the ſacred Canons, <hi>alſo,</hi> the laudable and approued cuſtome of the Church, hath obſerued, and doth obſerue, that this ſame ſacrament muſt not be conſecrated after ſupper, nor recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the faithfull when they haue broken their faſt, &amp;c.

(there is agayne for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond piece.) That which you report is one thing, and this is an other thing.

as I haue here declared, neither of Doctor, as in the nexte chapter I will declare. Falſe, becauſe not ſo much as one worde of Scripture, from the beginning of Geneſis to the ende of the Apocalipſe, maketh for you in any thing, nor againſt vs in any thing, as in this Chapter I doe ynough to perſuade therein any reaſonable man, and therefore it is but a falſe ſleight of you Heretikes, and a mere deception of the ſimple, when you be ouerthrowen by Apoſtolike traditions, by auncient Fathers, and ſo by many other our weapons in Chriſte, as in the laſte Chapter your ſelfe haue confeſſed, to ſette a bolde face vpon it, and vaunte, that yet for all that the Scriptures be plainelye for you, and plainely againſt vs. In which boldnes your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie cryeth euen to heauen, when you dare yet vaunt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſo farre, to ſaye, that the Church of God is faine therefore, to blaſpheme the holye Scriptures, ſeeing them to make ſo plainely for you.

                     <hi>All knowledge that Chriſtian men haue of heauenly things</hi> (you ſay,<note place="margin">Pur. 449.</note> to mainteine your argument) <hi>is grounded vpon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Gods word,</hi> meaning the Scripture. <hi>Therefore as it is no good Logicke, to conclude negatiuely of one place or booke of Scripture, This is not conteined in it, therefore it is not true: So of the whole doctrine of God, wherein all trueth neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is conteined, the argument is moſt inuincible that conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth negatiuely thus: All true doctrine is taught in the Scripture, Purgatory is not taught in the Scripture, therefore Purgatory is no true doctrine.</hi> Letting Purgatory alone till anone, there are two faultes, I ſay, in this reaſoning. One, becauſe the <hi>Maior</hi> is falſe, as to all your textes alleaged for it, I haue anſwered. The other, becauſe although the <hi>Maior</hi> were true, yet can not the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be oppoſed to our argumentes, as you oppoſe it in the laſt Chapter. You might, if the <hi>Maior</hi> were true, labour to the purpoſe (I graunt) in prouing the <hi>Minor.</hi> But you might not, I ſay, for all that, make of it an oppoſition or exception, when we make argumentes out of Traditions, Councels, Fathers, &amp;c. as in the like I ſhew vnto you: I proue a doctrine vnto you out of the Old Teſtament, you oppoſe therevnto your negatiue argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſay to me: All true doctrine is taught in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament (for ſo you do holde, and muſt holde) that doctrine is not taught in the New Teſtament: therfore that doctrine is no true doctrine. Is this well oppoſed of you? May not I ſay to you not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, Yea ſyr, but for all that, what ſay you to my place alleaged out of the Old Teſtament? vnleſſe you haue any thing againſt the Old Teſtament it ſelfe.

Alſo Num.</hi> 19. <hi>Diuerſe ordinances concerning the dead. yet neuer any ſacrifice or prayer for the dead.</hi> With like reaſon you might conclude vpon the ſame places, that the dead ſhould not be buried, becauſe in theſe places no mention is made thereof: and againe of ſundrie other places,<note place="margin">Leuit. 15.</note> where the people are bidde to keepe them ſelues warily from diuerſe contaminations of them ſelues by towching certaine perſons aliue, that therefore in the ſame places they are forbidden to pray for the ſaide perſons aliue, and namely during the cauſe of ſuch contamination, as for a man or woman whoſe ſéede or flowers runneth. You ſuppoſe ignorantly that in thoſe places orders are giuen what ſhall be done for the dead, but it is not ſo: onely it is decréed, that whoſoeuer entreth the tabernacle or houſe of him that is there departed, ſhal be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminate or vncleane after the Moſaicall maner: and that the high prieſt ſhall not enter to any ſuch at all, nor other prieſts but to certayne.

                     <p>From the particuler places of the Law, I come now with you to the whole Law thus, according to your good Logike, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude negatiuely therevpon:<note place="margin">Pur. 455.</note>

                        </q> To this you would make a reply, and therefore you correct your <hi>Maior</hi> with an addition, and ſay, that not onely all lawfull Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were preſcribed by the law, but alſo with <hi>peculiar men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning and playne rehearſing of all ſuch perſons for whom Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was to be offered, both men &amp; women, the princes and the priuate perſons, the prieſt and the whole congregation, yea and ſpeciall regard of the oblations of the poore, as may be ſeene Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.</hi> 4.5.12.15. But becauſe all theſe perſons are founde in the dead, as well as in the liuing, your addition reacheth yet farther, ſaying, <hi>And in the peculiar rehearſing of diuers kind of perſons, and the fourme of the Sacrifice, named according to euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtate, it is ſo farre off that the dead ſhall be reckned, that ſuch things are enioyned euery of theſe particular perſons to do, as it is playne that none but the liuing could offer, or haue Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice offered for them.</hi> And in confidence of this addition, Ieſu, how you befoole D. Allen: And yet it conteineth this groſſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie, which you ſaw not, that none could offer or haue Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice offered for them, but onely ſuch as were both liuing and alſo preſent in the place, yea alſo able to do by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues thoſe things enioyned, and moreouer that none might offer for their friendes, or for any other, but for them ſelues only. And what place is then left for offering for their children, for the ſicke at home, for their brethren in other countreys captiue or pilgrimes, for the kings and cities of the world, vncircumciſed, &amp; for diuers other ſortes, for which there was offering, as partly in other places is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, partly may eaſily be proued? And therefore all this adoe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth nothing againſt Sacrifice for the dead, although it coulde not be proued: much leſſe, conſidering that it is in an other place ſo playnly expreſſed. For <q>
                           <hi>the fact of Iudas Machabeus putteth all out of doubt,</hi>

                        <p>And firſt, D.

Fulke ſayth, that <hi>This is manifeſtly ouerthrowen by the worde of God, euen from the foundations. For the foundation of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is the diſtinction of veniall and mortall ſinnes.</hi> Not ſo ſyr: the doctrine is, that mortall ſinnes by the Churches remiſſion become as veniall: and you graunt it your ſelf, ſaying, <hi>All ſinnes</hi> (except certayne, of which your good exceptions I ſhall ſay more anone) <hi>by Gods mercy are pardonable</hi> or <hi>veniall.</hi> Thus you graunt the doctrine, and yet you graunt not the foreſaid diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therfore the diſtinction is not the foundation of that doctrine, but the doctrine may ſtand well without it.</p>
                        <p>But yet for other cauſes we muſt be content to ſée what you alleage againſt the diſtinction: <hi>The worde of God playnely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth, that euery ſinne is mortall &amp; deſerueth eternall death, ſeeme it neuer ſo ſmall.</hi> So you ſay, and you alleage thrée places for it. The firſt: <hi>Curſed is euery one that abideth not in all thinges that are written in the Lawe to fulfill them, Deut.</hi> 27.

Ioan. 1.3.</note> for ſo we can. But we can not ſinne mortally, holding (I ſay) Chriſt and his ſpirite. And therefore if we do ſinne mortally at any time, depriuing our ſelues thereby of Chriſtes ſpirite, the remedie is to ſéeke for the ſame agayne by the Sacrament of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and then are we in good caſe agayne as before.</p>

But the Catholike might anſwere the Origeniſt, ſaying: I ſyr: but howe proue you that mercy, that God (I ſay) is good to them that repent not? that he will giue his owne ſo fréely to them, to whom was not applyed at all the Satiſfaction of his iuſtice made by Chriſt?

But we muſt not do ſo, we muſt aſcribe all to Gods mercy: it is his mercy that he calleth vs bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ydle afore, yea ſinfully occupied, into the vineyard of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, there to worke for the peny of euerlaſting life: it is his mercy, whatſoeuer we do worke in the ſaid vineyard, one more and in ſhort time, as Mary Magdalen, another leſſe, though in longer time, as Simon the Phariſée, but all is of his mercy, of his grace, according to the meaſure as Chriſt (he alſo béeing his Chriſt) by his merites requireth for euery one, of his iuſtice: and therfore both the workes with all their varietie, and the pence in the end with all their varietie, are both of Gods giuing, though the pence be the <hi>merces,</hi> wages for the working, and that alſo by bargayne.</p>

                        <p>Well, by al this you haue not yet proued, that Chriſtes bloud whenſoeuer it waſheth, waſheth continuallie and at once to the full. Yea the ſaying of Dauid is manifeſt for the contrarie: Hée was waſhed from his ſinne by Chriſt, and yet he prayeth for the ſame ſinne, ſaying, <q>

                           <note place="margin">Pur. 154.</note> Too light in déede, to beare downe anye doctrine of Chriſt. <hi>But</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>thus wee reaſon: Chriſte hath payde the full price of

                        <p>Therfore to agrée al theſe Scriptures and Truethes together, what could be more apte, then (as we be taught in the Schooles) that there be thrée ſortes of working cauſes, <hi>Agens principale, Inſtrumentum coniunctum, Inſtrumentum ſeparatum,</hi> as in one writing, I do write as the principall, my hande doth write as the inſtrument vnited vnto my perſon, and my penne doth write as the inſtrument ſeparated from my perſon: Eche of theſe working the whole worke, and not parting it betweene them. It is ſo in the working of our Saluation: The Godhead worketh it principally: The Manhoode of Chriſt, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of it, namely his Paſſion, worketh it, as the arme of God: The Sacramentes worke it, as his inſtrumentes diuided from his perſon: And ſo likewiſe his myſticall members, the faithfull, with their works, do worke it, as it were meanes and agents perſonally ſeparated from him, though myſtically vnited vnto him. And they part it not betwéene them, but eche after his maner worketh the whole. And that is it which the Scripture meaneth by <hi>helping,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Pur. 241.</note> (the word that your ignorance ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth,

when it ſo often ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God helpeth both Chriſt, Pſa. 17. and vs, 2. Cor. 2. Heb. 13. And alſo that Chriſt helpeth vs. Heb. 2.</p>
                        <p>But yet there is a difference in this ſimilitude.

This is the playne text of that place: As likewiſe in all the New Teſtament, lightly euery where, <hi>life after corporall death,</hi> ſignifieth the reſurrection of the bodies, where the ſoules be in the meane time, here is neuer a word: no nor of the Saintes of the old Teſtament afore the inſtitution of Baptiſme: wherevnto beliefe in him giueth now acceſſe, Ioa. <hi>1.</hi> and <hi>3,</hi> that belieuing in him, they may haue life, Io. <hi>20.</hi> But their ſtate we muſt gather out of other places of holy Scripture.</p>

As the like would be a iuſtification of your new Goſpell, if you could ſhew out of Scripture, that Luther was preordeined for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Againe in the ſame place you alleage, that <hi>Eſay ſpeaking of the righteous that are departed out of this life, ſaith that ther is peace, and that they ſhall reſt in their beds, Eſa. 57.

<q>
                              <hi>There is peace,</hi> ſay you: but he ſaith, <hi>There ſhal come peace,</hi> or as the Churches tranſlation hath no leſſe agreably to the Hebrew, <hi>Let peace come</hi> I pray.

Alſo if their ſoules did reſt, muſt euery reſt néedes be the bliſſe of heauen?

Such was their caſe in <hi>Limbo.</hi> It was not hell, you ſay, becauſe it was not <hi>Tophet</hi> or <hi>Gehenna.</hi> Why? our Créede and the Scripture ſaith, that Chriſtes <hi>Soule</hi> was in <hi>hell,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Infra ca. 12.</note> and yet no man ſo wicked except it were Caluine him ſelfe (I thinke) to ſay, it was in <hi>Gehenna.</hi> Therefore Gehenna or To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the place for the wicked, was not the onely hell.</p>
                        <p>As vaynly, and more falſely you argue that it was not hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Luc. 16. <hi>Lazarus was caried by Angels not downe to hell,

                           </hi> you ſay, and he <hi>looketh vp, and ſeeth a farre of Lazarus in the boſome of Abraham.</hi> The ſame wiſe argument againe: In this place this is called hel, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no other may be called hell, although the Scripture it ſelfe els where nameth to vs another hell.

                        <p>Another of your manifeſt argumentes, being the laſt in that place: <hi>If righteouſnes belongeth to Abrahams children, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of righteouſnes alſo pertaineth vnto them.

Paule declareth, that a perfect iuſt man goeth ſtraight to Chriſt: The example of the Theefe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that likewiſe a penitent ſinner, goeth ſtraight to Chriſt, if either his penance be full and perfect, or his pardon, which is a remiſſion of his penance, be a plenary. And the ſaying, Ioan. 17. ſpecially béeing illuſtrate with theſe two examples, declareth as much: howbeit by it ſelf alone it declareth no more, but that they which are Chriſtes, may and ſhall be with Chriſt, but when, it ſayth not. You allude there to one place more, which is Rom. 14. <q>
                              <hi>We liue to our Lord,</hi> and <hi>we dye to our Lord</hi>
                           </q>. Whereby he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, that we be with our Lorde when we dye, no more then he meaneth that we be with our Lorde when we liue: but that both in our life and at our death, from the beginning to the end, we be not our owne men, but ſeruantes to another, and that he therefore is my Iudge if I do not well, and not thou: alſo to him I my ſelfe muſt make my count, and not thou for me. This béeing the ſenſe of that place, you had forſooth great reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it with Apoc. 14. to controll S. Auguſtines ſenſe,<note place="margin">Pur. 436.446.</note> who <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it of Martyrs,</hi> which is there ſaide, <q>

                              <hi>Feare the Lord</hi> (ſaieth one Angel, preaching to all the world at that time) <hi>and geue honour to him: becauſe the</hi> very <hi>houre of his Iudgement is come: and adore him,</hi> adore not Antichriſt.

Lo this is the circumſtance. Wherby you ſée, the place ſaith not ſo much as thoſe Martyrs to be at reſt ſo ſoone as they dye, but onely within a very ſhort time after. This is the place that quite ouerthroweth Purgatory.</p>

                        <p>After theſe two aſſaylings of Purgatory, by going ſtraight to heauen, and by the iudgement, there remayneth your third &amp; laſt aſſault,<note place="margin">Pur. 421.</note> wherein you ſay to vs: <hi>We learne by Scripture, that your doctrine is contrary to the faith, and hope of Chriſtians.</hi> And how ſhew you that?<note place="margin">Pur. 382.</note> 
                           <hi>If it be againſt the hope of Chriſtians to mourne for the dead, much more it is againſt the faith and hope of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to pray for them. For by our prayer we ſuppoſe them to be in miſerie whom the word of God doth teſtifie to be in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to be at reſt, to be with Chriſt, Io.</hi> 17. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.

Neither to mourne for ſome, yea and for all, is ſaide to be againſt Hope. I would haue you knowe that they ſhal riſe againe, ſaith the Apoſtle, <q>
                              <hi>to the end that you mourne not</hi>

So then, there is one maner of mourning without hope, and there is another maner of mourning with hope, and ſuch is our mourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with prayer. When Chriſt praied for his own Reſurrection, Pſal. 15. Act. 2. did that argue him to be voide of hope, or rather to haue hope? When alſo we all pray for the generall Reſurrection, <hi>Thy kingdome come,</hi> and mourne and grone for the dilation, do we againſt hope, doe we not rather moſt manifeſtly declare oure hope thereby?</p>
                        <p>Moreouer you ſaye there: <hi>To that which is required of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe worde of God, forbidding prayers for the dead, we anſwere that all places of the Scripture that forbid prayers without faith, forbid prayers for the dead.

Yea I ſay further, It is agaynſt that which the Apoſtle there both inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth and expreſſeth, to wit, that we ſhould pray for our brethren after they be dead, if they ended not their life in ſinne, becauſe that praying is according to Gods will. For it foloweth there immediatly:
<q>Who ſo knoweth his brother to ſinne (he vſeth the preſent tenſe, and not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfect tenſe, <hi>to haue ſinned,</hi> becauſe his intent is to exhort alſo the ſinner to leaue by time) <hi>a ſinne not to death,</hi> (as one that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Schiſme, but yet was reconciled before he dyed) <hi>let him</hi> (after his death) <hi>requeſt</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>and life ſhall be giuen vnto him, to one,</hi> I ſay, <hi>ſinning not vnto death.

This is the playne and ſmooth ſenſe of that whole place: and ſo muſt néedes be, becauſe there is no man nor no ſinne in this life, but we may pray for him and it, as neither the Nouatians (as bad as they were) did denie. Onely the Proteſtantes denie it, becauſe they haue no other ſhift to auoyde this place: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by let any indifferent, any Chriſtian man iudge, whether this be not a playne place for praying for the dead.

                  <p>What Scripture he alleageth about the firſt ſort, I haue in the two firſt partes of this chapter reported them al, &amp; anſwered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſauing a very few, which I reſerue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tenth chapter which ſhall be of euery Motiue or Demaund apart by it ſelfe.

This ſayth S Paule, and the ſame ſay we. But after he is ſo iuſtified, he muſt not do the like agayne, he muſt then kéepe the commaundementes of the Law, béeing now by Chriſt made a new man, and able therevnto, and by ſo doing he ſhall be more iuſtified, as S.

This doth not take away from vs naturall fréewill, nor naturall aptnes of will, as it doth not take away our ſelues from vs; but onely it ſheweth, from whence we haue power to do as we do in matters of ſaluation, to witte, of Gods gift, and not of our ſelues.

For bodily exerciſe is profitable vnto litle: but religion is profitable vnto all things, hauing promiſe of this preſent life, and of the life to come. <hi>Now what Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you, to ſhew that by</hi> bodily exerciſe <hi>he meaneth faſting and abſtinence from wine or fleſh?</hi>
                        </q>
The thing is playne, if we marke and conferre no more but the words of this place it ſelfe: that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſe is that, which is done for the body, to preſerue it in health, &amp; in this preſent life. to the which moſt men, yea prieſtes and biſhops ſometimes are too much giuen, miſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding much time in walking, riding, hunting, hawking, and ſuch like, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of their bodies: and litle or no time at all in ſpirituall exerciſe, that is to ſay, for the preſeruation and increaſe of their ſoules in godlines &amp; religion, wheras the ſame notwithſtanding is (as we know by Gods promiſe in diuers places of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) profitable both to that litle, which they ſéeke for by ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſe, that is, to this preſent life (in ſo muche that many holy Ermites &amp; Monks, liuing continually in ſuch exerciſe, haue paſſed the age of a hundred yeres) and alſo which is inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable to the life to come. And therefore S. Paule abſteined and faſted him ſelfe, to auoyde eternall damnation, as your ſelfe confeſſed a litle afore, <hi>Ne reprobus efficiar, leaſt I become a reprobate,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> ſaith he, and not onely that, but alſo <q>
                           <hi>to get coronam incorruptam, a crowne incorruptible.</hi>
                        </q> And the place is much to be noted for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with this place which we haue in hande, becauſe he there
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:11533:92"/>
calleth it his <hi>running,</hi> and <hi>fighting,</hi> that he did ſo ſharply vſe his owne body, ſaying that he did therein imitate the ſchollers of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſe, to wit, <hi>the runners in gole,</hi> and <hi>fighters at barriers,</hi> who, to make them ſelues more nimble &amp; actiue, <hi>abſteine from all things,</hi> and yet no more but to winne <hi>a corruptible crowne,</hi> being as litle a thing as that litle that he ſpeketh of to Timothie, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much leſſe, though of ſome eſtéemed much more, ſuch preſent glory (I ſay) compared with this preſent life and health thereof. Thus you ſée by conference moſt manifeſtly, what is bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and that you cleane contrary, not knowing white fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blacke, take it for faſting &amp; abſtinence, for that exerciſe (I ſay) which the Apoſtle there oppoſeth to it, and counteth ſpirituall, or exerciſe vnto Godward. Which ſpiritual exerciſe, as S. Paule, ſo his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple alſo S. Timothie vſed in like champion maner: Amongeſt other poyntes of it, to kéepe him ſelfe chaſt, he abſteined wholly from wine, &amp; drunk nothing but water, though being maruelous weake of body.

                        <note place="margin">Pur. 76.</note> No ſyr, I haue ſhewed you what the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>bodily exerciſe,</hi> and that he counteth this to be <hi>exerciſe vnto godlines,</hi> and that it profiteth ſo much as importeth, beſides this life, which is but litle, the auoyding of damnation, &amp; the winning of a crowne in heauen. Howbeit for al that, they which are weak of body, muſt runne &amp; wreſtle as they may: Timothie muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he is excéeding féeble, and therfore not alwayes to drinke water onely, and yet withal, that he is young, and therfore not to be very bold of wine, but vſe a litle only.

That they be Sacraments I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe we reade not there: no more do we 1.

                     <p>S.

Is this to ſay, that all men are iuſtified before they come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and that all Sacramentes be Seales of ſuch a matter? yea or ſo much, as that all Iewes were iuſtified before they came to Circumciſion, and that Circumciſion it ſelfe was to them a Seale of ſuch a matter? This is your euident Scripture, this is your neceſſary concluding vpon it. Goodly geare forſooth, that for it we muſt leaue the Catholike Church and her guyde the holy Ghoſt, and go to ſchole to Caluine.</p>
                     <p>Other poyntes of your ignorance are about <hi>the Holy ſpirite of promiſe.</hi> You ſaye, it is <hi>the meane to make vs partakers of the frutes of Chriſtes paſsion,</hi> Item, <hi>the meane to graffe vs into his body,</hi> Item, that <hi>it worketh in vs faith.</hi> By all which you declare that you know not what the Spirite of promiſe is, and that you are no conferrer of Scriptures together, how muche ſoeuer you bragge thereof. Varietie of matter bréedeth prolixitie againſt my wil, though of euery one I ſay neuer ſo litle: which I beſéech the gentle Reader to conſider. Otherwiſe in this matter I might lay together ſo many Scriptures as would fill the moſt gréedy that is. Briefly, Chriſt the day he aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded (as often afore both he,<note place="margin">The Spirite of promiſe. Sac. of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> and S.

                           <hi>to exſpect in Ieruſalem his fathers promiſe, which you haue hard</hi> (quoth he)
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:11533:94"/>
                           <hi>of my mouth: for Iohn baptized with water, but you ſhall be baptized with the holy Ghoſt, not many dayes hence,</hi>
                        </q> to wit, the tenth day off, béeing Whitſonday. They had faith afore, and they were baptized afore, and therefore graffed into his body afore, (though not fully baptized, not fully graffed:) and yet they were to receiue this ſpirite, this promiſe, as being (not <hi>the meane,</hi> &amp;c. but) the very greateſt fruite of Chriſtes paſſion, the complement of baptiſme, the full ingraffing into his body which is his church, yea the very inheritance it ſelfe. For the inheritance is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers promiſe, Rom. 4. and ſo in Geneſis, and in all the Olde Teſtament: And this ſpirite is) as you heare) the Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, called therefore of S. Paule, <hi>the earneſt of our inheritance,</hi> becauſe it is the full firſt fruites thereof. And therefore ſo farre as the Goſpell goeth, ſo farre alwayes goeth this ſpirite together with it: to the Iewes, Act. 2. to the Samaritanes, Act. 8. to the Gentiles, Act. 10. As to this day in the Catholike Church, where the ſame Goſpell continueth, it is ſtill giuen to all the bapti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zed, by impoſition of the Biſhoppes handes.
<q>Marke it well: it quite ouerthroweth your new inuented Goſpell, wherein after faith, and after baptiſme, you giue not this ſpirite: euen alſo your owne place to the Epheſians Cap. 1. condemneth you: <hi>for there it is ſaid to the Epheſians, that firſt</hi> they heard the word of trueth, the Goſpell of their ſaluation, <hi>then that</hi> they beleeued in Chriſt,, <hi>and then</hi> after beleeuing, you were ſealed with the holy ſpirite of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance.</q>
                        <q>If this be not playne ynough, conferre Acts. 19. where the very ſtorie of it is reported, concerning twelue Epheſians, who <hi>were baptized with Iohns Baptiſme,</hi> afore S. Paule came vnto them: and then were taught by S. Paule, that <hi>they muſt beleeue in Ieſus.</hi> Which when they heard, <hi>they were baptized</hi> (by ſome miniſter of S. Paules) <hi>in the name of our Lord Ieſus. Et cum impoſuiſſet, &amp;c. And</hi> after that <hi>Paule</hi> him ſelfe <hi>laying his hands ouer them, the holy ſpirite came vpon them.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, what is <hi>to burne</hi>? To be troubled with the pricking of the fleſh, ſay the heretikes. Not ſo, ſaye we: for S.

                           <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee: for my ſtrength is perfited in infirmitie,</hi>
                        </q> that is, where one acknowlegeth his infirmitie, and ſéeketh to me for ſtrength, there do I moſt ſtrongly worke. A notable enſample thereof is S.

As alſo millions of millions in the Catholike Church haue experience in them ſelues, néeding therfore no other argument againſt you al, but their own conſcience, to condemne your brutiſh aſſertion of ſuch impoſſibilitie.

                        <q>Marke the wordes: <hi>If they do not conteine them, let them marry, for</hi> (of the two) <hi>it is better to marry, then</hi> (not to conteine, or) <hi>to be burned.</hi> And the ſame as plain in your other place Heb. 13. <hi>Mariage is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable in all, and the bed</hi> (that is matrimoniall copulation) <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, for fornicators and aduowters God will iudge.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all this, and what ſaith he elſe, but, Let the married <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>This is the onely place, of all that D. Allen doth alleage for Purgatorie and prayer for the dead, which Fulke pretendeth any Doctor to ſay that it ought not to be expounded thereof.</p>

                           <p>Thirdly, He <hi>confeſſeth that he tooke this matter in hand, that men might haue pleaſure in it, which could not away with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious long ſtories of Iaſon.

In your preface to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Reader, you ſay: <hi>I haue vſed great bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, by a naturall inclination, whereby I loue to be ſhorte in any thing that I write.</hi> Do you compt your inclination a vaine incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?

                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>He ſheweth what labour and ſweat it was to him, to make this abridgement, ambitiouſly commendeth his trauill, and ſheweth the difference betwene a ſtory at large, &amp; an abridgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: al which things ſauour nothing of Gods Spirit.</hi> And ſpecially that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end (for al this you carp in the preface 2.

                              <hi>M. Allen aleageth the authoritie of Hieronym in prol. Mach. But what he meaneth thereby or what place he noteth, I know not,</hi> quoth you, Who wil beléeue that you are ſo dul?
<q>
                                 <hi>In the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare Latin Bibles is a preface vpon the bookes of Machabées: in it are theſe wordes:</hi> The Bookes of Machabees although in the Canon of the Hebrewes they be not had, yet of the Church they are noted among the Stories of the diuine Scriptures.</q>
Thoſe vſual Prefaces are taken commonly of S. Hierom, ſomtime for word, ſomtime for ſenſe, and ſo is this, as will appeare by the two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that you bring out of him. <hi>In his preface vpon the Booke of Kings</hi> (you ſay) <hi>he doth not onely omit it in reherſall of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall bookes, but alſo accompteth it plainly among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal.</hi>
                              <q>He there reporteh, how many letters are <hi>apud Hebraeos, with the Hebrewes,</hi> to wit, two and twentie: and that according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (number for number) <hi>primus apud eos liber, the firſt booke with them is Geneſis,</hi> and ſo forth to two &amp; twentie.</q>
                              <q>So expreſſy he ſheweth that he rekoneth the bookes there after the Hebrewes, and therefore that he ſpeaketh of their Canon, when he ſaith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that <hi>all without theſe is to be put among the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall. Therfore Sapientia, which is commonly intituled Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Ieſus booke the ſonne of Sirach, and Iudith, &amp; Tobias and Paſtor</hi> (for that booke alſo he mentioneth among the bookes of the old Teſtament, of which onely, and not of any of the new Teſtament, he there ſpeaketh) <hi>non ſunt in Canone, are not in the Canon. The firſt booke of the Machabes I found in Hebrew. The ſecond is a Greeke.</hi>
                              </q>
Now what maketh this for you or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs? doth any of vs affirme that theſe bookes were in the Hebrewes Canon?</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:11533:109"/>
the booke of Prouerbes: Therfore euen as the Church readeth in deede the bookes of Iudith, Tobias, and Machabees, but yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not among the Canonicall Scriptures: So alſo theſe two bookes (Eccleſiaſticus, and Sapientia) let her reade</hi> (as ſhe doth) <hi>for the peoples edification, but not to confirme the authoritie of the Churches doctrines:</hi> to wit, againſt the Iewes (that is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,) becauſe their Canon hath not theſe bookes in it. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Churches people they were alſo then read publikly and ſolemly in their courſe as well as the other bookes of Scripture: As S. Auguſtine alſo witneſſeth of one of them by occaſion, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Auguſt. de Praed. San. cap. 14.</note>
                              <q>The booke of Sapientia hath bene thought worthy to be recited at the deske in the church of Chriſt, tam longa annoſitate, ſo long a rew of yeres: and with worſhip belonging to a booke of diuine authoritie, to be harkened vnto of all Chriſtian men, from Biſhops, euen to the loweſt ſort, of laymen, faithfull, peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes, and Catechumenes. <hi>This was that reading of it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples edification.</hi>
                              </q>
And euen ſo S. Hierome expoundeth him ſelfe in his Preface vpon the booke of Iudith, ſaying:
<q>
                                 <hi>With the Hebrues the booke of Iudith is read among the Hagiographal</hi> (not amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the <note n="(a)" place="margin">Hieron. prol. galea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in li.

The authoritie of which boke is thought leſſe fit to confirme thoſe things that come into contention</hi> (betwéene the Hebrewes, no doubt, and vs.) <hi>But</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Hebrues counting it Apocryphal) <hi>the Nicene Councell (as we reade) hath reckned this booke in the number of the Holy Scriptures.</hi> As alſo S. Auguſtine diſtinguiſheth, ſaying:<note place="margin">Aug. de Ci. dei. li. 18. ca, 36</note> 
                                 <hi>The ſupputation of the times after Eſdras to Ariſtobulus, is not found in the holy Scriptures which are called Canonicall, but in others: among which</hi> (others) <hi>are alſo the bookes of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees, which, though the Iewes do not, yet the Church counteth for Canonicall.</hi> By all which it is playne, that S. Hierome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not as the Proteſtantes do, when he ſaith, that <hi>the Church receiueth not the bookes of Iudith, Tobias, and the Machabees, among the Canonicall Scriptures.</hi> (For him ſelfe ſaith, that the booke of Iudith is Canonicall by the Councell of Nice) but only as I haue ſaide, he inſtructeth the Chriſtians béeing ignorant in the Hebrue tongue, what bookes they ſhould vſe againſt the Iewes (for which cauſe he alſo addreſſed his new Tranſlation

of the olde Teſtament out of the Hebrew, as in many places he proteſteth,<note place="margin">Hie. Apol. ad Ruff.</note>) and that the Church in Canonizing thoſe other bookes, meant not for all that that they ſhould be vſed agaynſt the Iewes, who receiue them not, and therfore would but laugh at vs for our labour.</q>
Howbeit alſo, if S. Hierome did ſaye in the Proteſtantes ſenſe, that the Churche then receyued not thoſe bookes neither in her owne Canon, that maketh nothing for the Proteſtantes. For we graunt, the time was when the Church did not generally receiue ſome of thoſe bookes. To make for the Proteſtantes he ſhould haue ſaide, that the Church, (and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any priuate perſon) neither did then, nor ought afterwardes to receiue them.</p>

                              </q> If thou demaund my faith, I hold that faith which at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riminum of three hundred and thirtie Biſhops was not onely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, but alſo by their ſubſcriptions ratified.<note place="margin">Au. contra Max. li. 1. in principio.</note>

Therefore they were bound to it, as you alſo now be bound to the Tridentine Councell: but they would not be holden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their boundes, as neither you will. And therefore it was to no more purpoſe to alleage againſt them that of Nice, then it is to alleage againſt you this of Trent, ſpecially they hauing that of Ariminum to pretend for them, ſuch a one as you (being of all great Hereſies, the beggerlieſt) haue none. Neither would we in the like altercations alleage againſt you the olde Councels, if you would plainely confeſſe them to be againſt you, ſo as you do confeſſe the Tridentine to be againſt you, and ſo as the Arrians did confeſſe the Nicene to be againſt them.

So are they not now, but both ſides, we and you, do claime them. And therfore now better cauſe to alleage them, euen alſo in the queſtion of the Church, then was in S.

                           <p>The Heretike there thinketh that the example of theſe miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries maketh rather for him, and ſaieth: Nay rather, <hi>As theſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of our Lordes body and bloud, Alia quidem ſunt, are one thing before the Prieſtes Inuocation,</hi> to wit, bread and wine, <hi>but after the Inuocation are turned, and be made other things,</hi> to wit, <hi>Chriſtes bodie and Chriſtes bloud: So alſo our Lordes body after his aſſumption is turned into the diuine ſubſtance,</hi> being therefore extant no more in his owne forme. The Catholike anſwereth ſaying: <hi>Nay, you are caught in your owne nette. Neque enim ſigna, &amp;c. For the myſticall ſignes do not after conſecration de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi> (to ſenſe, as you teach of Chriſtes body after his aſcention) <hi>from their nature. For they abide</hi> (to ſenſe) <hi>in their former ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and figure, and forme, and may be ſeene and felt as before. Intelligu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur autem ea eſſe quae facta ſunt, &amp; creduntur: But to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> (though not to ſenſe) <hi>and to faith, they be the things which they are made: &amp; adorantur vt quae illa ſint quae credun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, and they be adored</hi> (by inclination and proſtration, as we heard afore out of S. Auguſtine, becauſe Fulke ſayth here, <hi>Not by any knocking or kneeling) as being in deede the things which they are beleued.</hi> Thus it is in the Myſteries, béeing likneſſes or an image. Therefore <hi>the veritie</hi> in like maner (ſaith he) that is, <hi>our Lords body</hi> in heauen, <hi>habet priorem quidem formam, &amp;c. Hath pardie the former forme, and figure, and circumſcription,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:11533:122"/>
and (to ſay all at once) the bodies ſubſtance: though it be after the Reſurrection made immortall and incorruptible, and ſitting at Gods right hande, and adored of all creatures.</hi> Meaning (as you ſée) by ſubſtance of the bread and ſubſtance of the body, all that is externall, as figure, forme, circumſcription, &amp;c. Which we in Engliſhe do by a like terme call the boulke of a thing. As for the interior ſubſtance, that queſtion belonged to his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to his aſſumption, whereof nowe they talke. Neither may any Logician thinke it ſtraunge for the worde <hi>Subſtantia</hi> to be ſo vſed, if he conſider well, howe the worde <hi>Corpus</hi> is vſed in the predicament of Quantitie, though it be otherwiſe a ſpecies of Subſtantia.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>But the myſticall likenes</hi> (ſaith the Heretike) <hi>chaungeth</hi> at the leaſt <hi>his former calling. For it is no more named, that which it was tearmed before, but it is called Body. Therefore alſo the veritie</hi> in heauen <hi>muſt be called God, and not Body.</hi> Not ſo, ſaith the Catholike: <hi>It is named not onely Corpus, Body, but alſo panis vitae, Bread of life.</hi> And ſo likewiſe <hi>the body</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <hi>we name it Diuinum corpus, &amp; viuiſicum, &amp; dominicum, docentes non eſſe commune alicuius hominis, &amp;c. The diuine and viuificall, and Dominicall body, teaching that it is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon one of ſome mans, but our Lordes Ieſus Chriſt, who is God and man.</hi> Where you ſée, that ſuche a difference as he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth betwene our common bodies and our Lord Gods body, the like he putteth betwene common bread and this bread of life, which therefore with him is Chriſtes body vnder the forme of bread (béeing thereby become as properly bread, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread is bread) and not the common ſubſtance of common bread, which no man can ſay to be bread of life.</p>

Secondly, that after this remiſſion: for all that, he may yet be in debt of ſome temporall payne. Thirdly, that he may and muſt pay the ſame temporall debt by workes of

                                 <hi>It is eaſie to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Epiphanius, that the olde forme of Liturgie was but to make mention of the dead, to haue them in remembraunce. And becauſe they vſed to make memory of all ſorts of men that were dead in Chriſt, he expoundeth it according to the error of his time. That this memory was a prayer for the ſinners, for the iuſt, as Patriarkes, Prophets, &amp;c. a ſignification that they were inferior to Chriſt. A ſimple cauſe why they ſhould be remembred</hi> (ſo that neither the old forme of Liturgie liketh you in remembring the dead at al:<note place="margin">VVil you ſee a pure Puritane.</note> no more then <hi>the old oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for the dead thogh they were only oblations of thanksgiuing,</hi> for they were taken vp of the Church in Tertullian and Montanus time <hi>by peruerſe emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Gentiles,</hi> ſo you ſaid cap. 6. pag. 53.) <hi>But this ſhifte Epiphanius is driuen vnto, becauſe he did not conſider, that the memorie and oblation which the old Fathers made for al the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in Chriſt, was a ſacrifice of thanks giuing, and not of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers for them.</hi> And againe: <hi>They had in deede in elder time,</hi>

                                 <hi>as appeareth by Epiphanius, the name of oblation: but it was for the Patriarkes, Prophets, Apoſtles, and Martyrs. Which playnly ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that it was but an offering of thanks giuing.</hi> You are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by thinking that it is but one memorie whereof Epiphanius ſpeaketh. Looke in the Liturgie of S. Iames, as alſo of S. Baſil, and of S. Chryſoſtome, &amp; diuers places of S. Auguſtines, and you ſhall find two diſtinct memories. And therfore Epiphanius ſaith:<note place="margin">Epip. Hier. 75. Aerij li. 3. tom. 1.</note>

<q>
                                    <hi>Pro peccatoribus quidem, miſericordiam dei implorantes, For ſinners pardie requeſting Gods mercy.</hi> Which is not his expoſition, as you pretend, but the very words of the Tradition, that is, of the memorie it ſelfe.</q>
                                 <q>Pro iuſtis verò, &amp;c. For the iuſt both Fathers and Patriarks, Prophets, and Apoſtles, Euangeliſtes, Martyrs, and Confeſſors, Biſhops alſo, and Anchoretes, and for euery order: Vt D. I.

He ſaw that the like me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie might be made alſo for our Lord him ſelfe, if it were but a thanks giuing.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though otherwiſe when the iuſt &amp; the ſinners are not ſeperated, but ioyned both together in ſome one Collet of the Church, then (as S.

Not onely theſe Councels (I ſay) do ſo clearely make againſt you, but alſo <hi>Vaſenſe,</hi> and the ſaide <hi>fourth of Carthage,</hi> which you pretende to haue anſwered, in ſaying that <hi>they are flatly falſified</hi> by D.

For though to all obedient Penitents at the point of death they gaue both reconciliation, and the fruite therof which is the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, yet they gaue not to all ſuch full abſolution from the reſidue of their penance, in caſe they recouered, as we ſée Con.

                              <p>But D. Allens anſwere (according to S.

The one Purgatorie fire, is, <hi>to puniſh</hi> (&amp; ſo to purge) <hi>by temporall paines,</hi> the ſoules for there ſinnes, <hi>for their euill life,</hi> though not ſo euill, <hi>vt miſericordia habeantur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digni, that they may be thought vnworthy of mercy.</hi> Of this Purgatory S.

                                 </gap>o certaine. The other Purgatorie fire is, as the fire of Tribulation in this life, for the moſt perfit alſo to paſſe through, euen them whoſe life was <hi>talis in bono, vt iſta non requirat, ſo good that they neede not to be releeued with the prayers of the Church:</hi> and therfore not to puniſh ſinne (as now we ſpeak of it) but only to weare out by litle and litle <hi>rerum ſecularium (quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis licitè conceſſarum, &amp;c. ſuche affections to worldly lawfull things,</hi> as to wife, &amp;c. <hi>that without griefe of mind he can not part from them:</hi> ſo as the other can which builded golde, ſiluer, and pearles, whoſe worke therfore is not burned vp, <hi>quia non ea di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexit quorum amiſsione crucietur, becauſe he did not loue thoſe things, with the loſſe wherof to be tormented,</hi> And of this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie S.

Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine inclined more to the other ſide) that there is not any ſuche Purgatory, but rather that after full penance for ſinne, or full pardon of it, the ſoule goeth without all delay ſtraight to heauen.</p>
                              <p>And ſo I haue ſhewed plainly what S. Auguſtine was certain of, and what he was vncertaine of: thinking good withall to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the Reader, that although for more perſpicuitie I name two Purgatories out of S. Auguſtine, yet I meane but one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory with two diuers operations, as it is but one fire of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in this life, though it haue thoſe two operations, to purge
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:11533:133"/>
ſinne with puniſhment, and to purge worldly lawfull affections with griefe of minde when we muſt in perſecution depart from our beloued. That alſo Purgatorie fire after this life, is for the firſt of theſe operations, it is certayne. Whether it be alſo for the other, it is vncertayne.</p>

Neither he that is clenſed in Purgatory, hath his merites either multiplied or amplified thereby, but onely his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſinnes and temporall debtes taken away. In the former place his words are theſe:
<q>Although Abraham were in hell, (<hi>or in the inferior partes</hi>) yet he was ſeuered with a long ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, ſo that there was an huge chaos inter iuſtos &amp; peccatores, quanto magis impios?

                  <p>In the 2. Demaund I reporte S.

For who ſéeth not in the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories and other monumentes of Antiquitie, that they gaue warning vigilantly and faithfully, as well againſt thoſe Heretikes that would haue corrupted but one or a few Articles, as againſt thoſe others that ſought to corrupt many or all?

                  <p>All this you haue ſaid, to defend, that our Religion might be falſe and of a later entraunce,<note place="margin">Ar. 36.</note> although it were not gayneſaid at the firſt entring of it.

                  <p>Now on the other ſide, that your Religion is not falſe, though it were withſtood by the true Paſtors in Aerius, Iouinianus, &amp;c. this you ſay:<note place="margin">Pur. 413.</note> 
                     <hi>They that defended that Heretikes ſhould not be baptized, were withſtood by Cyprian and all the Biſhops of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, who were in the vnitie of the Church: yet were they not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, nor their opinion hereſie.</hi> Much forſooth to the purpoſe.

                     <hi>nihil nouandum, niſi quod traditum eſt, to make no innouation, but keepe the Tradition.</hi> And therfore it was an hereſie, and they that helde it obſtinately (as afterward the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſtes and Luciferians) were Heretikes, and the <note n="(c)" place="margin">Euſ. li. 7. ca. 2.3.4.

                  <p>But yet you haue in ſtore one example about this rule, to dorre vs withall, and to ſhew, that <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ar. 93.</note> 
                     <hi>the Romiſh Church can well inough abide, the true Religion of Chriſt to be damnably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed (by wicked men) not only without (open or priuie) repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, but alſo with allowing.</hi> Which is no worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you hold here of the true auncient Church which you cal your owne. But your example out of <hi>Matthaeus Pariſ.</hi> is cleane agaynſt your ſelfe. For it ſheweth manifeſtly, that neither thoſe <hi>Friars prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> which attributed too much to Religion or life Monaſticall, nor thoſe <hi>Pariſian Doctors,</hi> which detracted too muche from it, lacked their reprehenders among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholikes, as they were all, vntill ſome of the Doctors afterwards proued obſtinat heretiks.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:11533:145"/>
And that <hi>when the matter was brought before the Pope,</hi> he tooke ſuch bleſſed order with it, as was very méete for his Apoſtolike See, to wit, that the Friars new ſcandalous booke <hi>ſecreto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bureretur, ſhould be priuily burned: for ſhaming their order,</hi> ſay you. And what fault was that, I pray you? Know you not, how S. Auguſtine vſed Pelagius and his diſciples in the beginning of their new doctrine, when he firſt wrote againſt them?
<q>Tacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da adhuc arbitratus,<note place="margin">Aug. Retr. li. 2. ca. 33.</note> &amp;c. I thought good not to expreſſe as yet their names, hoping that ſo they might more eaſily be amended. Imo Pelagij ipſius nomen non ſine aliqua laude poſui: quia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta eius a multis praedicabatur: Yea <hi>in my next writing</hi> expreſsing the name of Pelagius himſelfe, I did it not without ſome prayſe: becauſe his life was commended of many.</q>
Thus did S. Auguſtin vſe one Monke, and him the author of a moſt peſtilent Hereſie, as he proued afterwards. And your Chriſtian ſpirite would haue all the order, all Monkes, the innocent alſo, ſhamed for the fault of a few. Such would haue bene your care to amend thoſe few: and ſuch your prouidence to ſaue the wheate, whereof theſe fewe might haue made as gret waſte, if they had not bine wiſely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as Friar Luther now hath made, for lacke of a ſiluer ſpurre and a Cardinals hatte: and as Eraſmus alſo might haue made, had he not bene made of by Catholike Biſhops farre aboue his merites.</p>
                  <p>Yet one ſhift more you may ſéeme to haue, where you ſay for your argument <hi>ab authoritate negatiuè,</hi> of the whole Scriptures authoritie negatiuely:<note place="margin">Pur. 449.</note> 
                     <hi>And this concluſion M. Allen him ſelfe made of mans authoritie, cap. 13. Purgatorie and prayers for the dead were not preached againſt at their firſt entry: Ergo they are true,</hi> or rather, there was no ſuch entrie of them as you imagine, but they came lineally and quietly from the Apoſtles. <hi>But of all mens authoritie it is falſe,</hi> you ſay. Howſoeuer the argument <hi>of all mens authoritie negatiuely</hi> be, good or bad, who but you would call this ſuch a one: All hereſies (according to the Scriptures, Fathers, and Hiſtories) haue bene preached againſt at their firſt entry.

What other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was our name, but the name of Chriſtians? In vnitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name were al together at that time. And when afterward Arius, and Luther began their partes, what offended the old Chriſtians, I pray you, to léeſe their old name? And kéeping their old name, what néede had the Arians to call them Homouſians and Athanaſians, or Luther to call them Papiſtes? was it of neceſſitie, or of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch? And therefore on the other ſide, the name Chriſtians being preoccupated, how could men talke of Arrius his faction, or of Luthers factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without ſome new names, as Aria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s?

Saxons.</hi> But this your reaſon hath no other ground, but onely your owne ignorance in the Hiſtorie, as I haue noted ca. 2. pa. 4. Where alſo you haue an euident demonſtration, that the faith of the Britons firſt, and of the Saxons after, was all one, becauſe the greateſt paynt wherein their Biſhops differed from S.

                     <note place="margin">Pur. 332.</note> and <hi>although the error of praying for the dead were receiued in other places,</hi> yet <hi>whether this Countrie were free from it, I am not able to ſay, nor you to proue, that it was infected with it?</hi>

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:11533:161"/>
Paule, or Cyprian?</hi> But otherwiſe for praying to Martyrs,
<q>S.

And therfore whether prayer be a ſacrifice, or no: and how it is, or is not, we nede not ſtand here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.

You ſaw this reply and therefore in another place you would moderate the matter, ſaying: <hi>The ſeruice of God hath ſmall neede of furniture,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ar. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>in outward things. For God beeing a ſpirite, is not worſhipped with outward Pompe, but with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and inward reuerence.

If Gods being a ſpirite admitteth ſome outward furniture well ynough, then haue you miſſenſed that text. The meaning is, that outward thinges, without the inward man pleaſe not God: But for all that the inward man may vſe outward geſtures, outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and other outward thinges, as Chriſt him ſelfe, his Apoſtles, and all the Church euer did. For ſo to do, is to adore God who is a ſpirit, in ſpirit &amp; truth.

                     <hi>We can eaſily ſhew it out of the Scripture,</hi> ſo he ſaith, but no word that he alleageth any where. But bylike he meaneth the place to the Corinthians, by which his fellowes do commonly reiect the Latin Seruice, as if it were that miraculous gifte which the Apoſtle there calleth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Loqui linguis, to ſpeake with tongues.</hi> Which alſo he doth not reiect, but moderate, for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of certayne much like to <note n="*" place="margin">Pur. 7.</note>ſome Proteſtantes that thinke all learning to be the tongues. Now if any learned man, ſéeing it is not the ſeruice that S. Paule there ſpeaketh of, thinke yet that one may argue thence at the leaſt <hi>a ſimili</hi>:
<q>
                        <hi>Let him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, firſt, that ſo the maner of the ſimple Catholikes, who praye to them ſelues priuately in the Latine tongue which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande not, is not condemned, but iuſtified. For,</hi> He that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in a tongue, ſpeaketh not to men, but (<hi>yet</hi>) to God. <hi>And,</hi> he that ſpeaketh in a tongue, doth <hi>alſo</hi> edifie him ſelfe (<hi>in ſpirite, that is, in affect.</hi>) For if I pray in a tongue, my ſpirite (<hi>or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) prayeth, though my vnderſtanding be without fruite. <hi>And therefore</hi> If thou bleſſe, <hi>or</hi> giue thankes in ſpirite, thou doeſt it well. <hi>But</hi> if there be no Interpreter, let him be ſilent in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and ſpeake to him ſelfe and to God.</q>
The difference is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that thoſe Corinthians receiued immediately of the holy Ghoſt, ſuch prayers in ſuch a tongue. And theſe Catholikes now receiue the like prayers of the ſame holy Ghoſt, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. Secondly, that the Church in her publike praiers doth not ſpeake in a tongue, becauſe the Latine tongue is not in Englande a ſtraunge tongue, ſo, as it were if one ſhould ſay Maſſe at Rome in the Engliſh tongue. And ſo the queſtion is not now the ſame, as was betwéene the Apoſtle and the Corinthians: but, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Church would do all things for edification, (as S. Paule commaundeth,) the queſtion is, whether this be obteined in the Publike prayers of the whole worlde, rather by the Latine tongue, that is to ſaye, by the Common tongue, or els by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall vulgare tongues, that is to ſay, by the Priuate tongues, To which queſtion, the Catholikes, drawing all to common or vnitie, haue one anſwer: Heretikes and Schiſmatikes, drawing
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:11533:164"/>
from the Common, and ſcattering into many Priuates, haue an other. At Corinth the caſe was otherwiſe, both becauſe the ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues were vtterly ſtraunge, and alſo becauſe the prayers were not Set and Solemne, in writing and cuſtome, but momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, ſuggeſted of the Holy ghoſt to ſome one for the time, ſo that of them they were not vnderſtood, there was no profite at all in their publication. And therefore they ſhould not publiſh them, but ſpeake to them ſelues and to God. Reade the learned Latin booke of F. Ledeſima the Ieſuite vpon this matter. He ſheweth at large and ſubſtantially, that it is neither neceſſarie, no nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, the Publike Seruice to be in all vulgare tongues, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Popes holines may (by the Councell of Trent) do ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with any Nation as he ſeeth cauſe.</p>
                  <p>And Fulke can not nor doth not denie, but that in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church all the Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Latine Church had the ſeruice in Latine, neither can he, or doth he denie, but many of the ſame Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had vulgare tongues of their owne which were not La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, as the Punike tongue, the Dutch tongue, the Brytiſh to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue &amp;c. What doth he then? He holdeth, that all the people (and yet once he dare not but adde, <hi>For the moſt parte,</hi> which is ynough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him) of the ſaid Nations, beſydes their vulgare tongues, <hi>ſpake and vnderſtood Latine.</hi> And how doth he proue this abſurd poſition? By the Germaine or French Councelles of Towres,<note place="margin">Turon. 3. c. 17. Magunt. c. 25.45.43. Rhem. c. 15.</note> Magunce, and Rhemes, in the time of Carolus Magnus. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one of his places is ſo plaine againſt him, that it ſaith, as we do now alſo, yf any man cannot learne (ſo ſtrange and hard was the Latine tongue vnto them) his Créede and Pater noſter in Latine, <hi>Vel in ſua lingua hoc diſcat, Let him learne it at the leaſt in his owne tongue.</hi> One other taketh order for Homilies to be tranſlated out of Latine into <hi>the Ruſticall</hi>

                  <p>But firſt, that the Reader may ſee whoſe aduerſarie you be herein, he ſhall heare S. Auguſtine. The Manichée had falſified S. Paule, making him to ſay, <hi>qui ſacrificant,</hi>

<q>
                        <hi>They do ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the diuels, and you therefore are communicantes with the diuels, if you eate of thoſe ſacrifices: euen as Iſrael</hi> ſecundum carnem, the Iudaicall people, <hi>eating of their ſacrifices, was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by partaker of the Altar in their Temple.</hi> Deinde ſecutus adiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xit, ad quod ſacrificium iam debeant pertinere, Then he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and addeth, to what ſacrifice <hi>the Corinthians</hi> now muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <hi>being Chriſtians and Iſrael</hi> ſecundum ſpiritum, ſaying: <hi>The Chalice of bleſſing which we doe bleſſe, is it not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the bloud of Chriſt?

And not onely S. Auguſtine, but the whole rancke of the holy Fathers doth teach the ſame, ſuch a Prieſthood to be and to continue in the Church, to offer ſuche a ſacrifice in the forme of bread and wine, tearming it after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,<note place="margin">Pur. 295.</note> in ſo muche that you alſo confeſſe, and ſay: <hi>Thoſe of the olde Writers which compare the celebration of the Lordes Supper with Melchiſedeches bread and wine,</hi> which, you ſay, <hi>they call ſometime the Sacrifice of bread and wine,</hi> noting that as though it made againſt Tranſubſtantiation, (which vayne col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection I haue refuted here cap. 8. pag. 148.) and alſo adding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>And yet but a ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing.</hi> Whether but for thankeſgiuing, and not alſo for procuring mercy, I haue here at large examined cap. 9. pag. 196. to 204. But that is nothing to the matter which we haue nowe in hande. For a Sacrifice of thankeſgiuing, is, and in the olde Lawe was a Sacrifice, no leſſe properly then a Sacrifice of propitiation. And the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Croſſe was both, I trow: and therefore the Sacrifice of the Altar to be the one, what doth that let but it maye be the other alſo? Likewiſe a memoriall Sacrifice of Chriſtes paſſion, no leſſe then a prefiguratiue Sacrifice, is a true ſacrifice, though it be not called his very paſſion, but by a ſimilitude.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Pur. 292.294.320.321.326.</note>And therefore you haue yet a better aunſwere in ſtore: <hi>We confeſſe</hi> (you ſaye) <hi>that of the olde Writers it is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Sacrifice, but vnproperly.</hi> And howe do you ſhewe that?

You might as well argue, that S.

And then ſéeing in Chriſtes death, open ſeparation of his body from his bloud, and in Conſecration myſticall ſeparation of them (becauſe the words do worke that which they ſignifie) you ſhould ſay, in both thoſe Chriſtes body to be properly a Sacrifice (as I told you likewiſe before cap. 6. pag. 47.) but in perpetuall virginitie, and other mortification, becauſe there is no ſuch ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our ſubſtantial partes, but onely of our affections from vs, they be called Sacrifices not properly, but onely by a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore and ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>Well then, what obiections haue you now againſt this Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Sacrifice of the Fathers and ours? Either that it is none at all: or that it is not <hi>a Sacrifice in Chriſtes body,</hi> as S. Auguſtine ſaid?</p>

                  <p>For beſides all this, I aſke you, whether Melchiſedeth were a Prieſt without all ſacrifice at all? If you ſay, yea, your Diuinity is contrary to Heb. 8.

What a blindnes is this in you, not to ſée Melchiſedech in his bread and wine, ſo expreſly mentioned, to be comparable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, whereas by the Apoſtle alſo the very omitting of his father and mother and genealogie is in Geneſis a ſhadowing of Chriſt? ſéeing alſo bread and wine ſo notably vſed in the world by the inſtitution of Chriſt.

So were not all the reſt in the time of the olde Teſtament, the miniſters of Aaron: but Aaron him ſelfe was Prieſt only in his owne time, and after him euery one in his time was prieſt aſwel as he: and therefore in that law were many Prieſts. So that the old Teſtament was like to England ſince the Conqueſt, hauing ſucceſſiuely many kings.

Do you know what he meaneth
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:11533:170"/>
by thoſe that are ſanctified? by their making perfect? by Sacrifice for ſinne? Verely you do not, as by &amp; by it will appeare. The ſcope of that Epiſtle is to exhorte the Hebrewes, that is, the Chriſtian Iewes (who were ſore aſſaulted of the other Iewes, partly with obiections, partlye with perſecutions) to perſeuer in the faith of Chriſt. He doth therfore tell them, that in the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there was not Remiſſion of ſinnes, but continuall commemoration of them, Heb. 10.

                     </q>, Heb. 10. that is (1. Cor. 6) the baptized. So that of their former ſins there is now no more reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, Iere. 21· &amp; therfore <q>
                        <hi>no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny offering for the</hi>
                     </q> ſame, Heb. 10. but if they dye, they go ſtraight to heauen. So mightily and ſo graciouſly doth that one oblation work in baptiſme. But what if after baptiſme they ſinne againe? For that S. Paule there doth not (at the leaſt,<note place="margin">The true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Heb.</note> directely) tell any remedie, becauſe his purpoſe there was no more but to exhorte the ſtanding to perſeuerance: and therefore he doth rather terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them ſaying, If they fall againe, <q>
                        <hi>Iam non relinquitur pro pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis hoſtia, now is not leaſte Sacrifice for ſinnes</hi>
                     </q>, that is to ſay, Chriſtes death will not worke with them in another baptiſme. This he telleth them: but remedie he doth tell them none. But we by his other Epiſtles, &amp; by the other Scriptures, and by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, do tell ſuch alſo againſt the Nouations, that the ſame one oblation of Chriſt hath prepared for them alſo a remedie, though not another baptiſme, yet the Sacrament of Penance. We magnifie it yet moreouer, and ſay, that it hath alſo prepared many other Sacraments beſydes theſe, to other ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler effectes, and in one of theſe Sacramentes, a Sacrifice alſo, in which it worketh to ſundrie purpoſes. By this appeareth (I ſay) your ignorance in things which yet you feare not to affirme, as that the Catholikes ſhould ſaye, <hi>Chriſt hath not made them that are ſanctified,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pur. 451.</note> 
                     <hi>perfect by a Sacrifice once offered for all: for the greateſt parte is lefte to the Maſſe.</hi> As though when one commeth to vs to be baptized, we diuided the remiſſion of his ſinnes betwéene Baptiſme and the Maſſe. This is your blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to think that to be againſt the honor of this one Prieſt, and of his one Sacrifice, which is highly for it, to wit, to haue vnder

And do not we ſay the ſame? Can any Heretike pleade as vpon our verdite, that he pleaſeth God in offering to him bread or wine, yea or alſo the body it ſelfe and bloud of Chriſt, ſo as all Prieſtes doe in their Caluinicall Communion, no leſſe then we doe in the Maſſe? And yet the Sacrifice of it ſelfe is ſuche, as pleaſeth God, and ſanctifieth the offerer, but for his owne indiſpoſition.

Pur. 373.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>was the firſt that went about to vſurpe authoritie ouer other Churches. He paſſed the bondes of his authoritie, in excommunicating of all the Churches of Aſia. Then manye Biſhoppes withſtoode him, ſpecially Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus of Lyons, and Polycrates of Epheſus,</hi> as <note n="a" place="margin">Euſ. li. 5. c. 23.24.25.</note> witneſſeth Euſebius.

The Storie was thus: The Churches of Aſia minor had receyued of S. Iohn Euangeliſt to kéepe oure Lords Paſch or Eaſter day not alwayes vpon Sonday, but with the Iewes, vpon the 14. of the Moone. In which cuſtome the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Rome (who had receiued of S.

But when they ſawe that a <note n="b" place="margin">Niceph. li. 4. ca. 36.</note> neceſſitie was put therein, in ſo much that the other maner was condemned by the Iudaizing Heretike <note n="c" place="margin">Tertul. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As now alſo if he would excommunicate them which receaue not the Counſel of Trent, it would ſéeme likewiſe to many, who notwithſtanding confeſſe that he hath authoritie ouer all. But what was the end of the matter? At length folowed the firſt Nicene Councel, and confirmed the ſame that the Popes had commaunded: in their Epiſtle to them of Alexandria, writing this of the Aſianes alſo: <q>

                  <p>Therfore theſe are two notable examples of vnitie with S. Peters chayre, as a thing moſt neceſſarie.

So perfect was the vnitie of all Catholikes at that time, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeth handſomly with your imaginations of local yea &amp; vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall corruptions, here cap. <hi>3.</hi> Now in this vnitie of trueth, yet was there diuerſitie of vſages.

                     </q> And who doubteth, but the vſages of the whole Church in vnitie, be of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authoritie then the priuate cuſtome of Rome alone?

And conſequently, that a Prieſt, who by his order may do all things that be of order, ſauing onely giuing of orders, is of another maner of order then a Deacon.

Wherefore S. Paule alſo in thoſe two places doth ſay, that all diuerſitie of giftes and offices is,

He had therefore in ſuche places to expreſſe the diuerſitie of greater and leſſer: but not neceſſarily of the greateſt and leaſt. And yet to ſtoppe ſuch Hereticall mouthes, he ſaith 1. Cor. 12. expreſly,

                  <p>The Proteſtantes finding the Primitiue Church (whiche they dare not denie, but it was the true Church, here cap. 2.) to be in many poyntes ſo playnly againſt them, that they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it them ſelues, (as here cap. 3.) do hold, that the true Church may erre vniuerſally, and alſo did erre, cap. 3.4. And therefore make their exception againſt it alſo, cap. 7. pa. 89. And that with pretence of Scripture to warrant their ſo doing, cap. 8. pag. 117. vnto which I haue fully anſwered. Herevpon in my 34. Dem. I affirme, that the vniuerſall Churches authoritie was alwayes counted ſo irrefragable, that ſhe would be and was beléeued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her onely word in all matters, before ſhe yéelded or we could conceiue the reaſons of her doctrine. And that S. Auguſtine wrote a booke vpon this againſt the Manichées, which he called <hi>De vtilitate credendi,</hi> Of the vtilitie of beléeuing firſt, before you vnderſtand.<note place="margin">Aug. retra. li. 1. ca. 14.</note>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Becauſe his friend Honoratus béeing a Manichée,</hi> did irride in the diſcipline of the Catholike faith, quod iuberentur homines credere, that men were commaunded to beleue, and not taught by certentie of the groundes (certiſsima ratione) what was true.</q>
Which to our Doctor Fulke is ſo ſtrange, that of D. Allen, ſaying he taketh it to be <hi>the naturall order of a Chriſtian ſchole,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pur. 4.5.</note> he requireth to ſhew <hi>where he learned that methode,</hi> &amp; affirmeth S. Paule Rom. 10. to teach <hi>a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary order,</hi> and calleth it <hi>a blind

And that is it which we ſay, that hearing what the Church teacheth, they may be bold to beleue it forthwith, although they heare not or can not attaine to the groundes: euen as they which heard Chriſt him ſelfe, and his Apoſtles after him, might boldly beléeue them. As he alſo did worke thoſe Myracles in the beginning to commend his own authoritie &amp; credite, and thereby to draw vnto him a multitude, which multitude ſhould alwayes after him moue the worlde to beleeue, as Myracles did at the firſt.<note place="margin">Au. de vtil. cred. ca. 13.</note> S. Auguſtine in that booke deduceth this at large, and concludeth:
<q>Rectè igitur Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae diſciplinae maieſtate inſtitutum eſt, vt accedentibus ad Religionem fides perſuadeatur ante omnia: It is rightly therefore apoynted by the maieſtie of the Catholike Churches Schole, that they which come to Religion, be firſt and formoſt moued (<hi>or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by certayne generall motiues</hi>) to beleeue.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore I ſay, that the Proteſtantes can not poſſibly be the Church, becauſe they do renounce the claime of ſuche au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. I ſay alſo, that neyther they nor no other ſecte in the world is ſo happy &amp; ſure of their faith, as we be, hauing a Schoole and Maſters that we may boldly beléeue in all thinges, becauſe Chriſt hath geuen them <hi>the Spirite of truth,</hi>

But that we hold alſo merits before grace, as they did, you will proue by the diſtinction <hi>De co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo &amp; condigno: For God is as much bound to congruity as to dignitie or worthines: and as he can do nothing againſt worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, no more can he do any thing againſt congruitie, which is a kind of equitie.</hi> We alſo our ſelues do hold, that a man of him ſelfe without Gods ſpeciall helpe, can not merite ſo much as <hi>de congruo,</hi> the grace of God (though we haue no reſolute warrant to call the contrarie Pelagianiſme or Hereſie) and that with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts then this of yours, or els we might hold our peace, which you can not. For you imagine that if God do not that which is congruous, he doth againſt congruitie. Not ſo, good ſyr, for it is congruous to his mercy to ſaue the ſimple, that followe you only of ignorance, and otherwiſe do liue in good works, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his welbeloued ſeruantes alſo praying for them. Yet to damne ſuch alſo becauſe they be out of the Church, is congruous to his iuſtice. Yea for God to ſaue al the world, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>digne to the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:11533:185"/>
merites of Chriſt: yet he damneth innumerable, becauſe that it is condigne to their owne merites.</p>
                  <p>Thus while you went about to ſtayne Gods Church in vaine, it is fallen out only by the way, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you your ſelues are Meſſalians for denying the grace of the Sacraments: Pelagians, for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſitie of Baptiſme: and Manichees, for denying Frée-will.

You ſay: truth hath teſtimonie of Gods word, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be affirmed or denyed by the diuell, it is all one.

Perhaps a friends gheſſe of mine is true, that they ſay ſo, becauſe they find it in ſome Arrian Crede that is

According to the ydle or rather hypocriticall diligence of Heretikes, who vſe in Credes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of their falſe doctrines to infarſe ſome nedeles truethes. Whereas the Catholike Nicene Councell thought it ynough in their Crede, to repeate and explicate onely thoſe Articles of the Apoſtles common Crede, of which Articles Heretiks had as then made queſtion. Is not this then a ſubſtantiall cauſe, to ſay that it was firſte reuealed to the Arrians to put it in the Créede: whereas it was before in the Apoſtles Créede? Though alſo if it were true, that the Arrians did firſt put it into the Créede, what is that to our caſe? They had not the Catholikes in that againſt them: yea it was a common Article of the Catholikes faith. The Articles of the Arrian Aerius were not ſuch.

What is this to your Articles, which onely olde wicked Heretikes did holde (we ſaye) againſt all Catholikes: They were fitte Articles for Heretikes at all times (but neuer for Catholikes:) as at this time alſo for Anabaptiſtes, Serueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Arrians, Suenkfeldians,<note place="margin">Pur. 421.</note> &amp; all the others <hi>that you count Heretikes as well as we doe,</hi> ſayth D.

You want but that (whiche is ſoone had, we know) figures and prophetes of another olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and miracles of healing the diſeaſed of all ſortes, of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the dead, and ſuch other petite matters, to make demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that Donatus then, or Luther now, is another Chriſt: and then we muſt be forced to graunte that you are as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and they as you. And yet for all that I thinke we ſhould not be forced to graunt that you haue the trueth: but rather it would folow (<hi>per impoſſibile</hi>) that the Apoſtles had not the truth. But it is well, that the Apoſtles were not the cauſe of thoſe Sectes and Diuiſions, no more then we now, their heires, be cauſe of your Sectes and Diuiſions. Your owne Diuiding of Chriſt (whiche is the Apoſtles and ours by Senioritie in right poſſeſſion) is the meritorious cauſe of them, as S. Auguſtine told the Donatiſtes. And the efficient cauſe, is your denying of all Catholike Principles, and holding of Onely Scripture, and that but ſo much as you liſte of your owne heades, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by euery ones priuate fantaſie, which you call the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.

And the very Maſters of ſuch things with vs, of Hebrew, of Gréeke, of Latine, of Poetrie, of Logicke, of Philoſophie, doe they (thinke you) count themſelues therefore learned in Diuinitie, which they neuer ſtudied? or better learned in it then the profeſſors of it, lacking the tonges or the eloquence of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as S.

This rather is <hi>rudeneſſe and barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> as in our Countrey to thinke a mere Grammer Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter ſufficient to be Doctor of Diuinitie, yea and a Biſhop al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, not for other qualities (of them I ſpeake not) but euen for Diuinitie. No, no, M.

cleane contrarie title, <hi>Seruus ſeruorum dei,</hi> which S. Gregorie of humilitie did begin. Thirdly you ſay, that <hi>the ſame Gregorie (as Hulderichus Biſhop of Auſpurge doth teſtifie) was the firſt that compelled Prieſtes to liue vnmaried. Which afterward, when he ſaw the inconuenience, he reuoked.</hi> And ſo you deſtroy your own enſample: for if he reuoked it, then is not he one that made a chaunge from his Fathers faith. You that will not beléeue all Antiquitie ſaying that Peter was at Rome, will yet haue no man doubt, but S.

He that will Laugh more at large at the fable, let him reade M. Cope. As for Prieſtes Mariage, I noted cap. 3. pag. 12. &amp; cap. 6. pag. 43. How they counted Iouinian an Heretike and a monſter, long before S. Gregories time, for allowing of it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are all the chaunges, that you note in the Church of Rome: vnleſſe I muſt count this another, where you note D. Allen to confeſſe,<note place="margin">Pur. 68.</note> 
                     <hi>that the old vſage of the Church was, firſt to ſet ſatisfaction, and then to abſolue,</hi> though <hi>now of late, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue before ſatisfaction hath bene more vſed.</hi> Both maners haue bene alwayes vſed, but the firſt, of old more then the ſecond, and the ſecond, of late more then the firſt. This ſaith D. Allen, and it is euident to them that are ſkilfull in Antiquitie: namely ſuch as did not make their confeſſion before they fell ſore ſicke, they were abſolued incontinently, and did their Penaunce after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards if they recouered. Hereticall Biſhoppes and Prieſtes were oftentimes receyued (vppon cauſe) by onely abſolution, without all ſatiſfaction, yea and permitted to continue in their honours alſo. The Churches care both then and now, was and is, to haue all ſinners truely contrite, before abſolution: and that is ſufficient before God. Neuertheleſſe ſuche as haue offended afore alſo, are cauſed to doe their duetie accordingly. A ſtraunge matter that theſe Heretikes, who haue quite taken all away, ſhould controll the Church although ſhe alſo had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

all away: howe muche leſſe, conſidering that ſhe hath not taken any piece away, but onely putteth that more often to the ſecond place, whiche ſhe was wonte (as it is a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent) to put in the firſte place more often: and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her power to edifie and not to deſtroye, ſeeing the people now ſo careles, that rather then they will doe ſuche pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce for ſatiſfaction, they will not come to confeſſion, and ſo dying without abſolution goe to damnation: and ſeeing withall, that whereas ſatiſfaction is no ſatiſfaction vnleſſe the partie bee firſte in grace, his owne contrition before was alone, but nowe it hath the helpe of abſolution whiche of it ſelfe conferreth grace, that nowe his ſatiſfaction muche more probablye then before, is not baren. And therefore muche leſſe ſatiſfaction nowe, like to be more auayleable then muche more before: and yet he is warned withall if he be a great ſinner, not to thinke but that he oweth muche more then he is inioyned: and therefore that he muſte eyther paye it otherwiſe in his life, or procure pardon for it by greater authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or els moſt certainely it will be exacted after his death.</p>

But you ſhew not, that any of theſe (if they were ſuch) did for all that chaunge Religion at Rome. S.

                     <hi>Si quiſquam Traditor per illa tempora ſubrepſiſſet, if any Traitor had crept into it al the while,</hi> becauſe our Heauenly Maſter hath ſaid vnto vs of euil Prelates,

and more copiouſly by Onuphrius and others. Mine owne chaunce it was in England long agoe, hearing a Proteſtant (who was counted a great Hiſtorian) ſtand vpon it, to ſay vnto him, that it was maruell, why among ſo many Hiſtoriographers not one made mention of her before Martinus Polonus, who was .400. yeares after her time. He therevpon brought out the ſame Martinus in a faire written hand, turned to the place, and behold, ſhée was not in the text, but in the Margine in an other hand.

                  <p>To make it yet more plaine, what a madneſſe it is to forſake our Churche, and turne to the Proteſtantes, I note in the next Demaund, Saluation to be ſo certainly in our companie and Religion, that the Proteſtantes themſelues dare not ſay, our people to haue béene damned for ſo many hundred yeares as they liued and dyed in our ſide. Whereas we ſay boldly, with the holy Fathers here Cap. 3. that whoſoeuer is a Proteſtant, not onely in all, but ſo much as in any one point (as were Aerius, Ioui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus, Vigilantius, &amp;c.) is therefore a damnable Heretike. But they dare not ſo ſay, neither of our Maſters, who knowing the preaching of thoſe fellowes, condemned them, and therefore could not be excuſed by ignoraunce. No not ſo much as of the very Authors of our Monkes and Friers, as S. Bernard, Saint Frauncis, S. Dominike, of whom what Peter Martyr ſaide, I reported Cap. 5. Pag. 33. the whole Chapter is alſo of Fulkes owne wordes to the ſame effect, ſpecially Pag. 30. where he dare not pronounce of manifeſt Papiſtes but that they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for building vpon the foundation in his ſence, though no
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:11533:194"/>
Proteſtant builde vpon the foundation in S. Paules ſenſe, as there I ſhew.</p>
                  <p>Therefore his Diuinitie maketh with me in this Demaund, rather then againſt me: although he denyeth ſome particulare Saintes of ours,<note place="margin">Ar. 23.24.25.85.</note> and alſo the Canonization of Saintes. An ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter it is for Heretikes, when they can not proue the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion to be hereſie agaynſt God, to make it by their Parliament Treaſon againſt the king, and then when they put vs to death for it,<note place="margin">Ioan. 19.</note> to ſay, we be <hi>no Martyrs, but Traytors.</hi> Euen as the perfidious Iewes made as though our Maſter could not be king ouer our Soules, but by Treaſon agaynſt Ceſar. So the Heretikes ſay of his Vicare. In ſuche caſting of their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous mouthes into heauen, they doe but conſent to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that ſhedde the Saintes bloud. Thoſe whom Gods Church hath declared to be Saintes, it is not Fulke, nor his baudy Bale that with all their durt can blotte them out of the booke of life. If S. Liberius were once an Arrian, might he not be canonized for a Saint repenting afterwards? Was not S. Auguſtine once a Manichée? Yet the trueth is (as D. Sanders ſheweth at large) that he neuer was an Arrian, nor neuer ſaide of any ſo to be, but onely by compulſion to haue ſubſcribed to the Arrians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne conſcience, or rather not to the Arrians, but onely to the depoſition of Athanaſius: So one or two of the Doctors wrote, béeing deceyued with the falſe rumour that the Heretikes had ſpredde, before the trueth was ſet out in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Hiſtorie. But where was your witte, when you alleaged againſt Canonization, the example of burning Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus the Heretikes boanes (who neuer was canonized) by commaundement of Bonifacius 8. in Ferraria, where they had worſhipped him twentie yeres Apocryphally? You ſay, king Henry the ſixt ſhould haue bene canonized, but onely for lacke of money ynough. When you bring your authors, you ſhall receiue your anſwere. We can not proue, you ſay, <hi>that the Pope and our Church hath canonized the Apoſtles and principall Martyrs.</hi> To make holydayes of them, &amp; to name them among the Saints <hi>in Diptychis,</hi> in the holy Canon of the Maſſe, is not this proufe ſufficient of their canonization? yea and that the Primitiue Church which did ſo canonize them was not your church, becauſe
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:11533:194"/>
you haue taken away their Dyptica, and their dayes, of S. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (I ſay) and of ſo many other moſt glorious Martyrs, which had ſuche canonicall memories in the Primitiue Churche alſo. Yea and would take away the Apoſtles dayes alſo, if you might haue your will, as you vttered here in the 22. Dem. in ſpeaking againſt all dayes of Saintes. O but you haue a better waye to know Saints, to wit, they <hi>whoſe names are written in the booke of life.</hi> You might do well to ſet out that booke in print, that we might correct our Callendar after it. If you haue not the booke it ſelfe, haue you any more certayne way to know who are written in it, then is the Churches declaration? Or do you allow her te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie in canonizing ſome Scripture for Gods word,<note place="margin">Saint Fulke by his ovvne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie.</note> &amp; reiect it in canonizing ſome men for Gods Saintes? But it is <hi>great iniurie to the Saintes of God, that they be not ſo accounted while they liue.</hi> Belike you would be called Saint Fulke, &amp; that out of hand. But for ought that I know you muſt tarry, vntill you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your doctrine and certaintie of Predeſtination farther. For as yet you teach no more but that your ſelfe muſt and do knowe your ſelfe to be predeſtinate, and ſo may canonize your ſelfe for a Saint for euer: when you teach that others muſt know as much of you, then blame them if they alſo do not canonize you. And in the meane time blame not the Pope for canonization, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare it to <hi>the making of Gods</hi> which the Heathen vſed: ſéeing it is no greater a matter then your ſelfe can doe, nor the title greater then men aliue ſhould haue, and ſpecially ſéeing <hi>Iohn Hus and Ierome of Prage haue</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>as ſolemne feaſtes</hi> in your <hi>Bohemians Callender, as Peter and Paule.</hi> No man els néedeth to take the paynes, your ſelfe build vp againe with one hand, that which you pulled downe with the other.</p>

I denie not, but there are Heretikes in al theſe Countreys, at the leaſt in corners. And therefore if all Heretikes be of your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and communion, that you may bragge as you doe. But the trueth is, that euen thoſe Heretikes alſo which be of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion out of England (if any be, for I doubt whether any will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a woman to be head of the Church, but only your ſelues, to name no other of your peculiar articles) yet are they not, I ſay, of your communion, nor you of theirs, as appeareth euidently by this, that neither in a Generall Councell, if you ſhould hold any) you haue authoritie one ouer another, no more then two diſtinct Realmes with their ſeuerall kings haue authoritie one ouer the other in worldly matters. But Catholikes in the meane time, wherſoeuer they are, they be al of one Religion &amp; of one commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Therfore to giue the ignorant ſome light in theſe matters: as S. Auguſtine ſaid often againſt the Donatiſts,<note place="margin">Aug. de vn. Eccl. 3. De paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib. ca. 8.</note> ſo do I. I ſay two things: firſt, that in all Nations &amp; parts of Nations where any of al theſe Sects are found, Catholikes alſo are found, &amp; day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do encreaſe. One example for all, of our owne Countrie, beſt knowen to our Countreymen: where although they be turned out of all their Churches (as in very few others) yet the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the people is knowen to be ſtil Catholike, &amp; in hart of our communion, though drawen againſt their wills to the contrarie, yea and innumerable of them reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled, as all in maner would be (who ſéeth not?) if they were at their owne libertie. Secondly I ſay, that Catholikes are in many Nations and partes of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where none at all of the Sectes are, or ſo fewe that they are not to be counted of: as in all Spayne, all Portugall, all Italie, moſt partes of Fraunce, many partes of Germanie, &amp;c. Wherby any man may eaſily conceiue, that the Catholikes at this day in Europe are incomparably more then all the Sectaries put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, encreaſing withall euery day (ſpecially by meanes of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries and Ieſuites for the purpoſe) and they diminiſhing. How much more, adding to theſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholikes that be in Africa, and in Aſia, among the old named Chriſtians of thoſe parts? And more againe infinitely, adding yet the innumerable new Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the farder partes of them both, conuerted within theſe fiftie yeres by the Ieſuites? And agayne the like <hi>in Nouo orbe</hi> vnder the king of Spayne, by the Friers: in ſo much that many
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:11533:195"/>
yeares ſince it is written of that alone:<note place="margin">Surius ad An. do. 1558.</note> 
                     <hi>Tot autem hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia in illo nouo orbe Chriſti, &amp;c. So many thouſand men haue in that new world receiued the faith of Chriſt, as may be in this our old world.</hi> So is the compariſon at this preſent time. But how much greater yet is the oddes, if we looke backe to the times paſt, and conſider, that in the Nations where now the Sectes are, a few yeares agoe all were Catholikes, they occupied all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo many hundred yeares together as from the firſt conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ech Nation.

Demaund. This is <hi>the Communion of Saintes</hi> in déede, &amp; not theſe ſcattered Sectes, much leſſe any one of them by it ſelf alone as our Engliſh Proteſtantes, &amp;c. Who alſo (as I ſhewed in the 40.

                  <hi>This is he, that chargeth the holy Fathers with contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both of the Gréeke Church, as S. Chryſoſtome, S. Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, S.

Bernard: and ſome of them with many contradictions: partly vnawares, I graunt, but for the moſt part wittingly and willingly, though alwayes vniuſtly and falſely, as I haue ſhewed in euery particulare. And ſo in concluſion, he hath in ſo charging y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fathers, done nothing els but added to the heape of his owne contradictions, and declared his double blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that he hath neither eyes to ſée when he contradicteth him ſelfe, nor when others doe not contradicte them ſelues. And of the ſame ſorte alſo be the Contradictions, which here and there he chargeth D. Allen withall. Let the Reader conſider them but a litle, and he ſhall ſtraight perceaue, that either they be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, or (which is more common) that to make a ſhew of a contradiction he falſifieth D.

(I vſe his owne wordes, <hi>ſayth he) and therefore can not haue remiſſion of his ſinnes in this life,</hi> ſhall <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> by tolleration of the bandes in the Priſon of Purgatorie recompence his debt, and come from thence into the bleſſed Preſence of Chriſt. <hi>This Propoſition neither in forme nor in ſenſe, is D. Allens. Doth he ſay,</hi> He that leadeth a lothſome life? <hi>Yea doth he not playnely ſpeake of him that now leadeth</hi> a Chriſtian godly lyfe, <hi>but will not be reduced</hi> to the perfection thereof, by repentaunce <hi>or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> of his lothſome lyfe paſt? <hi>Loe, ſuch are thoſe Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                  <hi>as for the Sacrifice propitiatorie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it was offered in the Law, only by the High Prieſt once in the yere.</hi> And beſides this, he findeth none but <hi>Sacrifices of thankeſgiuing in the Law.</hi> Wheras <hi>Sacrifice propitiatorie</hi> and <hi>pro peccata, for ſinne,</hi> are all one:<note place="margin">Leu. 16.</note> and <hi>Sacrifice for ſinne</hi> was offered not only that one day in the yere which he meaneth, to wit, in the feaſt of expiation being the tenth day of the ſeuenth moneth, but alſo in many others of the Feaſtes ordinarily. Nu. 28.29. and extraordinarily whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer occaſion was miniſtred by ſinne of the Prieſt, prince, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or any one priuat perſon. Leu. 4.5. and vpon ſundry <note n="*" place="margin">Leu. 6.</note> other occaſions beſides. And touching the diuiſion of Sacrifices, there were foure kinds of them, as S. Paule ſheweth out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pſalme,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. Pſal. 39. Leu. 1..23.4.7. Pur. 455. Pur. 224.456.</note> and it is to be ſéene playnly in Leuiticus: <hi>Hoſtia, Oblatio, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locauſtum, &amp; pro peccato.</hi> For theſe other two, <hi>Sacrifice for thankeſgiuing,</hi> and <hi>pro delicto,</hi> belong to the firſt, and the laſt. I will not here ſay to you as you do to D.

And when he had gotten Hieruſalem and the Temple, is it not written playnly,<note place="margin">1.

Auguſtine, as you be of Caluine, you might haue eaſily remembred that he ſaith the very ſame that D. Allen doth.
A piece of Pelagius his hereſie being that a man may liue without all ſinne,<note place="margin">Au. de nat. &amp; gra. c. 36.</note> he alleaged for it the example of ſo many iuſt perſons commended in the Scriptures, and among the reſt, <q>

                  </q> Howe you woulde haue anſwered him, we ſée: ſpecially thinking you haue Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for her ſinning, becauſe Chriſt ſaid vnto her: <hi>Why did you ſeeke me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 2.

You might do well to tell vs what were thoſe ſinnes of hers.
S. Auguſtine could not ſée any there, nor els where, but ſaith playnly in his anſwere to Pelagius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the contrarie had bene for his vantage againſt him: <q>
                     <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the holy Virgin Mary, of whom for the honor of our Lorde, I will haue no queſtion in the worlde, when we talke of ſinnes.Inde enim ſcimus, for by this we know, that more grace was giuen to her to ouercome ſinne altogether, becauſe ſhe was worthy to conceiue and bring forth him, whom it is certayne to haue had no ſinne.</hi>

Pelagians, &amp;c. againe on the contrarie ſide, becauſe theſe are not, nor were not (by you) in the Church, therefore they be not Heretikes.

And if you alſo goe about to anſwere ſome of our Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is no otherwiſe then the Arrians, Pelagians, &amp;c. did in old time, who notwithſtanding were obſtinate againſt the truth, becauſe they yéelded not neither when the Church had giuen her ſentence. So do we proue you to be obſtinate, &amp; much more then any, becauſe you neither yéeld after ſentence, and alſo do hold that the Church hath no ſuch authoritie to end contentions.</p>
               <p>Your ignorance in ſo wondering at D. Allen for ſaying, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> a Chriſtian Scholer ſhould firſt beléeue, and after ſéeke for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, I noted before cap. 10. Dem. 34.</p>

For, there was viſible ſeperation of his Body and Bloud, the one from the other: Here is myſticall or ſacramentall ſeperation of the ſame, as the ſacramentall wordes doe ſignifie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſeperation is but like to that, if we attende the maner of both: and yet it is the very ſame ſeperation, if we attend the thinges that were and are ſeperated.

                  <note place="margin">Pur. 198.201.</note> Whereunto you ſay, that <hi>Euery boye in Oxford can tell him,</hi> that by Logicke, <hi>like is not the ſame.</hi> An high point: D.

               <p>THus at the length with the helpe of God I am come to the end. And yet the Reader muſt vnderſtande, that I finde in this man ſuch ſtore of this ſtuffe, as would ſuffice to make another volume as big as this: partly by enlarging theſe two laſt Chapters with many more of his like contradictions, &amp; errors or ignorances (for all the former Chapters be full freyted) partly by making many new Chapters vpon new matters. As one, to ſhewe howe he behaueth himſelfe in all places where he chargeth either the Catholikes doctrine or D. Allen himſelfe, with contradictions. Another, to lay together all his falſifications of the Scriptures, Doctors, and D. Allen, by adding, diminiſhing or chaunging their wordes. Another, of his moſt impudent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing lyes without any colour of truth. Another, of his deteſtable raylings not only at D. Allen, but alſo at the old Doctors, and at Rome, and at the whole Churche, which he can not auoide (the Scriptures, with his owne confeſſion, are ſo plaine for it) but it is the true Church his owne Mother, and Spouſe of Chriſt. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his ridiculous anſweres to many of D.

One of thoſe Chapters might be, to gather all the Scriptures alleaged by D.

Another, of ſuch bookes in antiquitie, as he denyeth, namely the workes of S. Dionyſius Areopagita, and the Conſtitutions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles by S.

Allen about other places of his, that they proue it not: as though Doctors opinion and iudgement being confeſſed, there néedeth any more to doe to be made about his ſayings. And yet it is nothing alſo which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to thoſe other places, as I haue ſhewed in very many of them. Another might be, to lay together all D. Allens argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes or reaſons for it, with my replies to Fulkes anſweres, ſuch as I haue made in diuers places of this booke. In another I could ſhewe, that Fulke hath made no anſwere lightly to theſe Scriptures, Doctors, or reaſons, but D. Allen did foreſée it afore hand, warned the Reader of it, and made ſo iuſt a replie vnto it, as ſtandeth ſtill vpright, euen after that Fulke hath done the worſt he could. Another might be, to ſhew out of Iuſtinus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Ireneus, and Clement Alexandrinus, in how many things they alſo make with vs moſt euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly (as in nothing againſt vs) becauſe he doth ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> require vs, to proue prayer for the dead by any of them, as though he would yéeld to them, although he will not to their fellowes: wheras in déede he excepteth againſt them no leſſe, as I haue ſhewed, then againſt the reſt. Another might be by occaſion of his zeale for Caluine, Luther, and ſuch other his Maiſters and fellowes: to ſhewe more copiouſly, that they are worthily charged, not onely with thoſe ſhamefull opinions by D. Allen, but alſo that they may be likewiſe charged with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many moe no leſſe, yea and much more ſhamefull then thoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe matters are ſuch, as being ſo handled, would worke the

further diſcredite of Fulke and of his ſide, and yet being no more handled, then alreadie, doe leaue no blotte in our ſide, no nor ſo much as in D. Allen particularly. For which cauſe I minde not neither hereafter, to proſecute them, vnleſſe I haue greater occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion geuen then yet I ſée. But preſently I omitted them, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide more prolixitie, and ſpecially becauſe in this booke I tooke in hand to defend, not D. Allen, but the Church: and therefore whatſoeuer this Heretike pretended againſt the Churche or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any thing of hers, I haue anſwered it all and euery whit, omitting nothing to my knowledge: and ſo ſhall be able (with the grace of God) and alſo readie, to anſwere him hereafter alſo, if he harden his heart yet further to make more reſiſtance againſt the trueth. Counſelling him rather, yea and beſéeching him in the bowels of the mercies of Chriſt, to be better to his owne ſoule, and to ſo innumerable other ſoules redéemed with the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud of Chriſte, then to ſtande any longer againſt the Church of Chriſt, to the damnation of ſo many ſoules, ſpecially hauing neither any text of Scripture, nor any other authoritie Catholike, againſt the ſame Churche, as I haue here moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declared. But if he liſt ſtill without cauſe to blaſpheme the Holy Citie and Tabernacle of God, let him knowe,<note place="margin">Apoc. 13.22.3.</note> and all ſuch as he is, that his name will be ſtricken out of it to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall confuſion, when our names, that through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God be of it, ſhall before all the worlde to our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable glorie appeare written in it together and in the booke of life of the Lambe and Sonne of God, to whom be glorie in the Churche throughout all ages for euer and euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
